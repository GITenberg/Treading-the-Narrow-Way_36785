<p>PREFACE</p>
</div>
<p>
The chapters in this book are not based on
fiction, they are not drawn from imagination,
they are not gems that come from culture and
learning, but are gleaned entirely from the
rugged school of life, and are for the purpose
of cheering the down-hearted to a realization
that a good life has its just reward, that
through continued combat every temptation,
obstacle and evil will vanish if a strict observance
of God’s law is kept in carefully treading
in the narrow way.

<p>DEDICATION</p>
</div>
<p>
To that dear teacher who urged me to go
to school when I was past twenty years of
age, and helped to mold in me the true principles
of honor.
</p>
<p>
To a fine Judge on the Bench whose many
fatherly talks to poor unfortunates, whose
feet had slipped from the narrow way, who
helped me to obey and respect the law.
</p>
<p>
To a splendid intellectual lawyer, one of
God’s clean home men, whose guest I have
been at many intellectual feasts, to him I owe
the avoidance of the saloon and learned the
intrinsic value of sobriety.
</p>
<p>
To my two eldest sisters, one sister-in-law,
and my devoted wife through whom I learned
the desperate struggle and what it means to
live clean.
</p>
<p>
To a poorly paid self-educated minister to
whom I am deeply indebted for the first introduction
to my master.
</p>
<p>
To these in the major part, and a few
others, God bless them all, I owe whatever I
am to them, to these dear people I affectionately
dedicate this book.

<h2><a name='ch01' id='ch01'></a>EARLY FOOTSTEPS.</h2>
<p>
Robert Emmett Barrett was the soothing
and patriotic cognomen my father fastened
upon me when I first opened my eyes and I
looked him squarely in the face. I say my
father named me and I honestly think he did.
The first two-thirds of the name proves my
contention and opens the book wide enough
that the reader has no trouble in discerning
the nationality of my father. Mother was an
English woman and I knew it the first time
she called father “Arry.” If mother had had
her equal rights in naming me, I might have
been a Gladstone; but somehow or other
father monopolized mother’s half interest
and she finally became disgusted and told
him to name me any blooming thing he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
wanted to. If mother could have foreseen
this savage war across the orient, I believe,
she would have handled the center name, but
the way it stands I wouldn’t shoulder a gun
for England and I can’t use my undeveloped
oratory against Ireland, and I am about half
persuaded to let them settle their own
troubles. It being no fault of mine that I
am half Irish and half English, I let it go at
that and get along with everybody the best
I can. It’s hard to separate the halves from
the whole, and so, from a perpendicular
standpoint, I give the Irish the top half and
the English the bottom half; I’d rather let the
English have the running half anyway.
</p>
<p>
So far the name Emmett hasn’t done me
much good, I’ve only used it nine or ten
times since I had it, thrice at political
speeches, a couple of Fourth of July
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
addresses, once on Decoration Day, once at
a church wrangle, and a few times when I
was mad. I find it doesn’t help me much on
bank cheques, they get turned down as
quickly with the Emmett signed as without
it. If the name is ever going to do me any
good I wish it would hurry up and be a progressive
or I will be compelled to think father
was impartial and talked mother out of her
rightful one-half interest.
</p>
<p>
After the ordeal of naming me had been
fairly or unfairly dealt with, I was told I
was a free born American citizen and some
day I might be President and have absolute
dominion over the blue room, where I suppose
the chief executive goes when he has
the “Blues.” I never considered this encouragement
very seriously, for, as I have read in
some almanac, there is only one chance in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
eighteen million, the odds are against the
slim chance and it’s sort of a blue skim milk
proposition or a church raffle affair, and if
it’s the only time that opportunity is going
to knock at my door I don’t think I’ll be at
home, I’ll let Wilson do the best he can and
let some live Republican Progressive have my
chance.
</p>
<p>
If Wilson would only hurry up and get the
Government to make those loans they’ve been
talking so long about and loan it, at about
four per cent, to citizens like myself, irrespective
of names and nationality, and not
have the principal come due too quickly, but
in periods, like twenty year franchises, I
believe he ought to have a second term; but
if he doesn’t get some loans placed pretty
soon I don’t know what hard working men
like myself are going to do.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
</p>
<p>
The only thing I ask Wilson to be careful
about when he loans the money is the rate.
I don’t want to see the rate on loans as high
as it was during Cleveland’s second administration.
</p>
<p>
I borrowed eighteen dollars in 1894 to settle
up a partnership fanning deal with a
Methodist preacher. It seems that outside of
the banks no one had any money, and you
had to call on the gentleman banker, get
down on your knees and have tears as large
as pullet eggs rolling down your hollow
cheeks, if you succeeded in your desires.
Somehow the bankers knew they had a good
thing; they not only got the fat and tallow
but they stripped you clear to the bone.
</p>
<p>
The eighteen dollar note was dated August
28, 1894, and read in part; “With interest at
the rate of ten per cent per annum”; and from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
here on comes the craftiness of the banker:
He interlined thus: “From January 18, 1894,
if not paid when due.” On October 23rd the
same year I paid ten dollars on the note;
September the 11th, 1895, six dollars; and
December the 5th, 1895 the final payment and
accrued interest was eight dollars and twenty-five
cents, making a total of twenty-four dollars
and twenty-five cents on a loan of eighteen
dollars for one year, three months and
seven days. What was the rate of interest
charged? That banker is retired and worth
a hundred thousand dollars; hadn’t he ought
to be?
</p>
<p>
To borrow money under that rate you
needed the health of a bear, a cataract of
energy, a colossal mind, unlimited self-respect,
boundless self-confidence, all impregnated
with an iron honesty. That kind of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
interest makes me feel like the investor, who
bought some unseen land from an honest real
estate man, and, when he went to look at his
property he found it submerged in water.
The real estate man told him it could be irrigated,
but he had no idea it was susceptible
of such profuse moisture. After he gazed
at it a while he said “Instead of buying this
land by the acre I should have bought it by
the quart.” He probably has an unrecorded
deed, I have the paid note in my possession,
I feel proud I got it paid; but my pride halted
suddenly when I got it paid and in all these
years it hasn’t advanced much for men who
can take a nickle and make it into a dollar so
all fired quick. Some time I’ll frame that
note with a glass on both sides of it.
</p>
<p>
Coming back to the early events. I was
born beneath the shadows of the Rocky
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
Mountains where the placid and sleepy Platte
wound leisurely through the broad meadows
and sleeping undeveloped valleys and had
abundance of God’s elixir before the day of
the great reclamation projects that sapped
its mountain waters.
</p>
<p>
Because I mention the Platte here, don’t
get me mixed with that other fellow that has
made the Platte famous and was until recently
holding a cabinet position on an underpaid
salary, he’s no relation of mine and
I never knew him until he ran for President.
He did the opposite from what I did and took
that one slim chance, made three strikes and
fanned; I’m glad I let it alone.
</p>
<p>
When I was six years old and my parents
still said what I should do they took Horace
Greeley’s advice and went a hundred and six
miles farther west. At their destination there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
was no buildings except the section house,
depot and a little building that sheltered the
hand car. The entire population was not over
a baker’s dozen. I don’t believe there was
a quieter place on God’s footstool.
</p>
<p>
One good thing about those days was the
taxes; I think a week’s compensation on the
railroad would pay the taxes, County, State
and Municipal from 1887 to 1890. How we
have progressed in taxes since then! Especially
Colorado.
</p>
<p>
In this little dreary place where I had no
associations to lead me astray I took account
of my surroundings. I was away out there
on the barren plains where the grass curled
and burned under the blazing sun, where
foliage was scant, where the lonely cactus
and prickly pear awaited the step of man to
imbed itself and cause more pain, no trees
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
or flowers to whisper words of encouragement,
no cheerful forest or shady dells, nothing
at all to cause the deeper emotions of a
queer nature to assert themselves. Nothing
but the broad miraged prairie stretching as
far as the eye could see.
</p>
<p>
No cooling breeze to alleviate the pain on
a youthful face or the faces of those careworn
early pioneers who blazed the way for future
generations, who would erect homes, till the
soil, plant trees, and endeavor to further
promote civilization, until succeeding generations
would reap the pleasure and peace that
was purchased through these sacrifices and
hardships of their forefathers. We owe to
the pioneers such a vast debt of gratitude
that we never can pay the the principal with
no interest attached, and it’s a different kind
of interest than four per cent a month.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
</p>
<p>
After I had grown to manhood and my lot
had been cast in other places it was over
fourteen years before I saw much of the old
scenes, but when returning to the old places
I noticed great changes. The town had
grown; few of the old places were left and
the old haunts and nooks were hard to find.
</p>
<p>
A dreary and quiet sadness steals over one
when looking at his boyhood and manhood
earliest recollections, and as I glanced at the
old scenes I stood and looked longingly,
earnestly and lovingly at the old familiar
places. There was the locust grove I helped
to plant two decades ago; there was the little
stream after which the town was named:
there was the old pump which so many times
quenched my thirst; there was the exact spot
where dearie said the joyful word; there was
the old house where our first baby was born;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
there was the farm patch I used to plow,
and the meadow where I pitched the hay.
All seemed different and as the pathos of the
change surged in my breast I walked away
longing for something I couldn’t get, and
would never get again.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span><a name='ch02' id='ch02'></a>GETTING THE BACKBONE.</h2>
<p>
About the year 1889 when I was seventeen
years old I commenced on the lowest rung
on the railroad ladder and went to work on
the section. I was frail physically, and must
have been the same mentally, for I never got
beyond the third rung. I worked in the days
when you spoke for the spring job the preceding
fall, and then often your application
met failure. In hard times when jobs are
few the fellow that has them is blessed with
unusual longevity, and whenever some one
did pass beyond, his demise was railroad talk
for a long time.
</p>
<p>
When you consider that all through the
central west, which had a few years earlier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
been homesteaded after several repeated crop
failures, almost the entire population were
looking for employment and the only cash job
in the country was a section job, you can
realize how desirable and prized a position
it was.
</p>
<p>
I don’t remember how it came that my
application was slumbering all through the
cold winter with a large number of those
half-starved homesteaders who hadn’t raised
anything for so many years, received recognition
in the spring; but it did and I got one of
the plums.
</p>
<p>
The first time I pumped a hand-car I fully
realized the Lord had made no mistake by
taking out one of the ribs and leaving the
backbone whole. If you ever pumped a hand-car
I will pass from this painful mode of
travel and let you refresh your own memory
and backache.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
</p>
<p>
I got along pretty well, when the “Boss”
wasn’t nervous that the road master would
come along and want to borrow another fifty
dollars on his word without interest, everything
went nicely. When weed cutting time,
came I gritted my teeth, held my back as
straight as I could and whacked away. Besides
the excruciating pain in the back that
made you feel like you would like to give
one long piercing yell, throw your shovel
away and run for town, there was the additional
pain of seeing the “Boss” sitting on
the hand car resting his back. He had the
advantage and the authority! I must keep
at it and cut the weeds or the wheels of the
locomotive would slip, the traveler couldn’t
resume his journey, all traffic would stop, and
down would go the railroad stock and let
out all the water.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
</p>
<p>
It would have been a blessing if the water
could have been spilled by some patent
process where the weeds were to be cut, but,
monopolies monopolize and if the Lord didn’t
see fit to have the rain fall in September instead
of June no one was to blame, except
Grover Cleveland. The Republicans said the
country always went to the dogs and dried
up when the Democrats elected a President.
I was too young then to know much about
statesmanship and I wouldn’t want to say for
repetition whether or not the Lord and Cleveland
were working together or otherwise, but
I do remember some one was mighty stingy
with the moisture.
</p>
<p>
If you, my dear reader, have never had the
privilege of cutting weeds for a dollar and
thirty-five cents per day for three weeks in
succession then, for all that’s good and beautiful,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
take my advice and let the Jap, Greek,
or Italian have your place and do the mowing.
Either of them can get better wages and any
of these dark-skinned brethren will do as
much in three days as the white man would
in one day and cause the pale face no extra
exertion.
</p>
<p>
The pain in the back caused from close
association with a shovel from seven o’clock
to twelve o’clock and from one o’clock to
six even now, over twenty years afterwards,
almost makes me break down and give vent
to my feelings in a more noticeable manner
than my friend Taft when he was informed
that he had carried Utah. If you have ever
been tortured with lumbago, you have a slight
knowledge of what races up and down the
back of a weed cutter. When he bends down
he can’t get up and when he gets up he can’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
get down. There you are! Humiliated, suffering
and mad, knife blade sticking you
whenever you move, but you must or bust.
You are a free born American citizen but
you must lose sight of the special endowment
when you are cutting weeds. The constitution
may be back of you, but just at present
you have got to get back of your own constitution
and a “darn” good one too, or
you’ve lost your job and that dearly beloved
stipend of thirteen and one-half cents an hour.

Being on the low rung of the railroad ladder
is the same as in all other departments,
the man at the bottom gets the low wages,
needs the good back and carries the heavy
burden. He don’t need much brain; he is
told what to do; how to do it and when.
He’s told when to go to work and when to
quit. Brains would be a nuisance and, if he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
had any, he wouldn’t be working on the section.
Time has proved that, and the Dago
takes his place.
</p>
<p>
What became of the Irish, Swede, German
and Bohemian section men of twenty-five
years ago is more than I know. Extempore,
an increase of brains did something for him
and you don’t find him tramping ties with
the Dago. But the man at the low rung
hasn’t much choice; he can work or quit.
His job is always in jeopardy as he couldn’t
save enough in a year to loan out an occasional
“fifty” to smooth the feelings of an
over auspicious road-master. He’s at the
bottom and whatever falls goes down to him
and in an undignified way he must carry the
whole load, for it can not go lower. The
general manager can ease his feelings on the
superintendent, and he on the road-master
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
and the road-master can growl at the section
foreman, but when the section foreman dumps
the whole putrid, half-boiled mess on the unlearned
day laborer you can see the urgent
necessity of a fine piece of choice workmanship
in the middle of the back. You seldom
see a man with a front like a wash-tub turned
edgewise working on the railroad. There is
no room for him! You must be able to see
your feet if you cut weeds, and have a stomach
that can say “Hello” to the backbone at
nine fifteen A. M.

When the winds used to tear loose from
the nasty bad lands of South Dakota and
come tearing over the semi-arid plains for
three days in succession at a velocity of sixty
miles an hour it seems the Lord could have
improved on man by giving him a gizzard to
grind up the accumulated gravel that had
been beaten into his daily bread. It came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
pretty near taking the hide off from me to
keep pace with those hungry homesteaders
who were afraid of losing their jobs and
existence.
</p>
<p>
I am glad that I had the backbone. The
term is applicable in two ways. One is the
acquisition of a resilient mechanism in the
center of your back, starting at the base of
your brain and running down to a certain
point or as far as is necessary, and the other
is a priceless stamina, determination and a
square deal. I am not sorry that I acquired
some on the railroad; its a good thing to have
in the every day affairs of life.
</p>
<p>
I hardened my backbone when I worked
on the steel gang a few years afterwards, and,
if there is such a thing as a steel backbone, I
claim some right to its possession through
low remuneration and dirty cabbage. Keen
retrenchment policies make better satisfied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
stockholders and also make wages that would
embarrass a bumble bee if he were buying a
pair of leggings and expected to pay for them.
</p>
<p>
It takes unlimited backbone for a congressman
to vote “Yes” on the prohibition amendment
and turn down the easy money of the
brewers. It takes backbone for a president
to cast custom aside and step into the halls
of congress and demand that the party
pledges be kept. It takes a better backbone
to enter the same halls and take a determined
stand on a cause that means better citizenship.
It takes backbone if the minister ousts the
liberal paying hypocrite who is helping to kill
the church with his pocketbook.
</p>
<p>
It takes backbone every day you live and
if you don’t use it in the way it was intended
you can’t tread the narrow path and expect
to slip into heaven without being recognized.
You may do it on earth but you must not try
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
it where you are known. It takes backbone
to be a Christian, the earnest conscientious
kind, that can lay all jealousy aside, all
prejudice and hatred and give the offender a
square Christian deal. Unless you can do
these things you CAN’T be a Christian, the
kind that Jesus told us to be. The other kind
is a sham and an out-and-out sinner is far
better. True Christianity will not allow one
individual to do another of the slightest
wrong. The conscience of a real Christian
will not allow any ill feeling or the harboring
of malice. You know it’s wrong, your conscience
reminds you of the wrong and unless
you remove that kind of Christianity you can
never receive the fruits that come from the
narrow way and be a successful Christian.
You know yourself if you are a sham so
why try to fool anybody and carry a false
label.

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span><a name='ch03' id='ch03'></a>THE TWO PATHS.</h2>
<p>
Don’t forget the warning of the Saviour
when he says: “Enter ye in by the narrow
gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the
way that leadeth to destruction, and many
are they that enter thereby. For narrow is
the gate and straitened is the way that leadeth
unto life, and few are they that find it.”
Travel the path that becomes shining gold,
the one that grows lovelier, the one where
you are never alone: You’ll need the friend
of this path when the heartaches and trials
are hard to bear. Don’t chance the other path
and sell your soul for pleasure, wealth and
damnation.
</p>
<p>
The journey of life, be it one of success or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
failure, closely resembles two paths. When
we reach the age of accountability we must
of our own volition choose one of these paths.
Where the paths commence to fork out and
go in separate directions we see a sign spread
clear across the entrance and it says: “I am
the way, the truth and the light.” We study
this for a long time and then go to the other
side and on the same sign board it says:
“Though your sins were as crimson they shall
be whiter than snow.” We are young, full
of life and can’t really understand what it
means but we are ready to start on life’s pathway
and there are only two paths to choose
from.
</p>
<p>
We look around and see the broad, open
path with no restrictions, filled with the aroma
of choice flowers, we meet social companions,
have gay parties, they tell us of the pleasures
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
they are enjoying. From this survey and
study we note that the broad path looks
cheerful and inviting, the narrow one seems
straight ahead as far as we can see.
</p>
<p>
We can notice that the crowd seems to be
going the broad way. People in all conditions
of life, well dressed, prosperous looking people
of wealth and affluence, and the ordinary
working people in their customary garb.
They look happy and contented, and we decide
to take the broad way.
</p>
<p>
We didn’t notice, until after the start, that
the course has a descending grade and we
get a long distance on the way before we call
a halt. We have seen a great many things
that are not elevating and we conclude that
after we go a short distance we’ll turn back,
start over and take the other path, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
though the things that looked so inviting at
the beginning are losing their attractiveness.
</p>
<p>
The demoralizing things we see are pitiful.
There is a poor fellow reeling with drunkenness.
MY! hear that vulgar, profane language
coming from the foul mouth of that
young man. There’s a party drinking wine,
laughing boisterously and telling stories that
are very improper for ladies and gentlemen.
There is a poor girl in a calico dress that
seems to be alone; her face looks sad and
she seems to be watching and waiting for
someone. There is a pitiful story in her once
pretty face that would cause you to weep if
you knew it.
</p>
<p>
Look at that old man with a gray beard;
he has been a powerful man in his day, his
well built physique tells that. He’s a man of
more than ordinary intelligence, his features
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
show fine breeding. He must have got on the
wrong path from not noticing the sign board,
he seems out of place here. I thought so.
He is turning back! My! how he stoops as
he commences the ascent. But he is sticking
to it. There he is telling a younger man of
the mistake he made and is trying to persuade
him to accompany him back. Well, isn’t
that splendid! They’re both going back. It
must have been that last remark that the elder
man said to the younger man that persuaded
him. “Lo, I am with you always even unto
the end of the world.”
</p>
<p>
There is a whole crowd about to start back;
are they going? No, they listen to that well
dressed fellow over there smoking a cigarette,
and holding up that beer bottle and he
has influenced them to go a little further. It
must have been that last remark he made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
when he told him there was going to be a
beer drink and a free dance at Switzers that
persuaded them.
</p>
<p>
They go on and on; they are commencing
to look ragged and worn out; the roses have
flown from their cheeks: their eyes are no
more full of lustre and keenness; the gray
hairs are showing, the step is not so firm, but
still they go on. Now they are old, they have
lived so fast and reckless that they haven’t
hardly got the strength nor the inclination to
start to climb that long hill that took forty
years of the best part of their lives to descend.
It seems an impossibility and they
do not desire to consider it.
</p>
<p>
Look at that poor woman over there.
Listen to the poor soul as she is down on her
knees and the tears are falling like summer
rain. Listen to her broken, sobbing words.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
My, isn’t she the most pitiful, dejected and
forlorn looking creature you ever saw! Hear
her as she sobs “Lord, I saw the sign but oh
I was so foolish, I didn’t heed it but I remember
it and dear Lord hear me, I’m old,
feeble and poor, I am friendless and I have
sinned and broken Thy laws. Oh take me
as I am. Amen.”
</p>
<p>
Who is there beside the blessed Jesus that
can pick up this poor unfortunate daughter
as she now stands before the bar of sorrow
and despair awaiting her dues? She was
given and entrusted with a pure and innocent
life in infancy but she was frivolous and
sought after wealth, power, position and the
many other transitory and fleeting things.
She took her clean, innocent life and so soiled
and stained it that it would be unrecognizable
to any one but he who gave it, and now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
when it is filled with barrenness, she comes
to her maker with her wasted life, when in all
candor and sense of fairness she could expect
nothing in return, but he says to her “Though
your sins were as crimson they shall be whiter
than snow.”
</p>
<p>
Then we see the other path that was trod
by the bleeding feet of the lowly Nazarene.
We know the anguish and pain he suffered;
we think of the fiendish death he died that
he might say to a sinful people; “Come unto
me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and
I will give you rest.”
</p>
<p>
This narrow and straight path may not be
so beautiful at the beginning as the broader
one. We think if we follow it all joys and
pleasures are gone. But what a mistake, for
each day that we travel, it becomes prettier,
the flowers are sweeter, the trees are greener,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
the skies seem bluer. We find temptations
and trials but we have some one to lean on,
and there is a sweet peace and enjoyment
known only to his followers. It makes it easy
to pass the saloon and enter the church. The
Lord is in that little church and his servant
there knows every man, woman and child for
miles around. See them cluster around him;
he loves them; each day he lives he does
some one a kindness. He listens to your
sorrows and heartaches; his joys are your
joys and never a word or thought but one of
goodness and kindness has he for anybody.
He looks tired today; he spent an all night’s
vigil at the bedside of a sick friend. Did
you see him when he stopped and caressed
that little girl who had broken her doll? It
meant something to her and he has won her
everlasting gratitude. See him talking to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
that young fellow over there who is wavering
and unable to decide which path to take.
Notice his warm and friendly attitude and
see, he has won his confidence and has got a
promise from him. See that sweet-faced,
light-hearted maiden, he has just come from
her home and she has consented to lead a
better life.
</p>
<p>
Look there, will you! He is helping up
that poor man whose feet slipped from the
narrow way and he is taking him home to
the broken-hearted wife. See the sadness on
his dear old face as he gives what comfort
he can to the poor woman; he’s back again
the next day and is talking to them both.
“Yes,” they said from now on they’d cling
close to the marriage vows. Don’t they all
look happy and pleased. There he is again
talking to a poor man who has been unsuccessful, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
worked hard, lived pure but went
too heavily in debt and can’t meet his obligations.
Worry is making him sorrowful and
shortening his days, but the dear pastor with
his hand on his shoulder and his warm words
of sympathy has a telling effect and the
heavy clouds are leaving his countenance and
as they part, each understands the other.
The cordial, glowing hand-shake is given and
both have received good. There he goes
again; he’s just married a young couple and
is advising them, he is telling them not to be
down cast when a snag comes along but to
work together, tread the narrow way, keep
faith in God, and He will bless and prosper
them.
</p>
<p>
There is pain in his heart today; he has
just come from the home of broken-hearted
parents who have laid away in the silent city
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
their first born. In his great love for them
he has told them about Jesus, the sorrowful
life he lived, the great pains and heartaches
he endured, and he did it all for them. As
he leaves they love him as a father and a
sweet peace has descended upon them and
the wound commences to heal.

</td></tr></table>
<p>
The greatest need in keeping in the narrow
way is in sincere and earnest prayer accompanied
by a tenacious faith, is the only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
source that leads to the full and sweet companionship
of the blessed Jesus. The every
near realization, what God can accomplish
for us fulfills the truth that the ever listening
ear of a just and righteous master has ample
succor for a burdened and heavy heart.
Faith without something to justify its establishment,
though it be ever so great, is in reality
groundless and contains no true merit, but
honest prayer for honest motives and coming
from a desirous heart is the great medium
through which sinful mankind, so prone to
err, is brought into a close relationship with
a wise and prudent God, a God who willingly
compensates every effort whose basis is a
true and unselfish heart.
</p>
<p>
Trust God fully at all times and pray with
such sincere, fervent and unselfish motives
as is only needed to replenish a pure and unspotless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
desire. When prayer is answered, as
God sees fit to answer, we can discern its
force and effect in our hearts from the
knowledge and fact that a change has taken
place and a deep feeling of keen satisfaction
has fully satisfied a craving want. If
this were not so the prayer alone without
any manifestation from a true and living
God, would be worthless. A long composition
of nicely polished words spoken to an
idol could in no wise be called a prayer.
The densest mind could surely realize that no
sympathy lies in anything not able to comprehend
a feeling. Silence would be better
and is more valuable. It is better to keep
still than to say something that would cause
some one to err or stumble.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span><a name='ch04' id='ch04'></a>GOD’S INTENTION MAN’S PREVENTION.</h2>
<p>
God’s handiwork and its beauty is manifest
wherever the eye rests. The towering mountain
peaks, the great boulders, the babbling
brooks, the peaceful valleys, the green grass,
the beautiful flowers, the shady dells, all
speak of his master hand. The moon-beams
playing on the still waters, the sunshine
streaming through the golden clouds, the perfect
poise and artistic shape of the trees
growing on the mountain side among the
jagged rocks where the hand of man never
trained or cultivated them. There they stand
as sentinels waving to and fro by the gentle
breezes and tell of His wonderful works.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
The wild flowers growing side by side in the
shady dell, each a different color, whisper His
wonderful plan. The little brook dancing and
playing in and out among the deep chasms
chiseling its narrow passage among the
granite, jumping over big rocks, rolling little
pebbles, it steals here and there until it
spreads out on the great plains and fertile
prairies into a rushing river hurrying on its
way to the ocean. The beautiful sun-set casting
its long stream of golden beauty over the
western sky mocks at the skillful artist when
he tries to imitate its marvelous shades and
tints. The moon breaking through the silvery
clouds and showering the heavens with beauty
and grandeur rests its glory on the evening
dew, and the millions of diamonds glitter and
glisten in a splendor and elegance far beyond
the hand of man. The many stars hanging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
like precious gems upon a great pedestal
twinkling and sparkling tell the same story of
His wonderful handiwork.
</p>
<p>
God was not satisfied with all these marvelous
things and, though they are perfect,
good and beautiful He must surpass them.
He must have a crowning effort to all their
glory. So to defy imitation He brought forth
His masterpiece and called it man. The incomparable
and unsurpassable, the grandest
achievement of his architecture. In his wisdom
He provided everything for his needs
and comfort. Sunshine to warm him, darkness
to rest him, trees to shade him, give him
fuel and shelter, birds of song to cheer when
weary with labor, flowers to beautify, soil to
produce whatever he sowed, rain and sunshine
to mature it, meats of all kind to nourish
him, fruits, fishes, grains, honey, milk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
and everything necessary for his growth and
sustenance, He made him pure, clean, strong,
and beautiful, just a little bit lower than the
angels. He furnished man everything to
start with. It was no disgrace if his hands
were blistered and dirty if they were stained
by honest toil, he fought hardships and privations,
he was the hardy pioneer blazing his
way for home and country, raising his children
near to nature’s heart and cleanliness.
He gave to posterity strong, hearty, rugged
men and women, he lived honorably, his labor
was rewarded and he died ripe in years
as a fitting tribute to his great achievements.
</p>
<p>
Time rolled on! Years became centuries!
Methods changed and the great plan of God
was lost.
</p>
<p>
Greed, avarice and monopoly commenced
to steal the bread from the infant’s mouth;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
the keen and bitter struggle for existence is
in full sway; the great land of liberty and opportunity
no longer can put forth her boast
and call and call for him to come, build
homes, prosper, live well and accumulate.
</p>
<p>
What changeful conditions today from
then! We boast of our great enlightenment
and yet we are like the drowsy cat under
centuries of domestication. As soon as the
raw meat is put before us all the centuries’
training is cast aside and we are ready to do
acts of barbarians. Instead of being able to
arbitrate and handle all questions of war
through peace tribunals we cast aside the
brotherly teachings of the great book, increase
the standing army, build more warships,
enlarge the navy, and be ready for
war, ready to shoot our brother, ready to destroy
his home, leave his children penniless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
and fatherless, a widow to struggle and
mourn, posterity to be enfeebled, a gigantic
debt to stagger many generations unborn, a
country bankrupt and all teachings of love
and better citizenship disgraced.
</p>
<p>
No wonder our people are discouraged and
feel we are slipping away from the preamble
of our great Constitution! If this age and
this country can not handle all questions, national
and international, and extend the fullest
measure of brotherly love where peace is
needed; what age or country can?
</p>
<p>
I think it may be America that will be
called upon to lead other nations and have
them cast aside their war preparations and
prepare for peace. In every crisis through
which this country has passed we have been
fortunate, thank God, that the right man has
always been found. We have had our Washingtons, Lincolns,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
Websters, McKinleys,
Wilsons, and hundreds of others and in every
instance when some great problem has had to
be solved, either in this country or abroad, in
either science, statesmanship, literature or
art, no matter how perplexing, difficult or intricate,
American brains and ingenuity, in the
vernacular of the day, has brought home the
bacon, Swift’s premium, if you please!
</p>
<p>
I have always felt deeply sorrowful for
the man who studies long and ardently with
a bowed head resting upon his hands. His
whole soul seems to be calling for the fine
sympathies that can only be rendered from
the loving teachings of the Nazarene. He is
calling for the tender affection that is keenly
necessary to right him just before that sullen
burning wave of despondency casts him into
utter gloom and sorrow. O Christianity!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
Christianity! amid wealth, society, culture,
influence, peace, advancement, laws, legislators,
and boasted liberty where art thou?
</p>
<p>
Visit the parks of any cities, towns or
small villages and you can find sitting on the
benches man after man who is unable to
solve the problem of an honest existence.
There he is, honest, clean, and worthy of
good citizenship, unable to find labor that
will keep him an honor to society. What will
become of him in this land of boasted opportunity
and liberty? Plenty for all; but monopolized
and organized until the laboring
man is almost ostracized. Look at his countenance,
clear cut, manly and open, haggard,
yes, but from what? From worry, loss of
sleep, lack of food, responsibility of a family
without funds, etc. But withal you find no
look of dissipation, no odor of liquor, no foul
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
language, and still with all these excellent
qualities of meritorious citizenship he is
sinking. How long will he stand it?
</p>
<p>
Were you ever in a condition of this kind
when any way you turned you were outfigured.
How long can a man have a thorn like
this continually getting deeper and deeper
into his flesh before he will make a grasp for
it, and endeavor to release the pain? Where
is the cause? What is wrong with our wide
heralded economic system? This condition
being true of the man with a family how
alarming to the young man of today without
a family? Show me any incentive or inducement
for the common ordinary man of today
without funds to cause him to establish a
home and rear a family under the grand old
Stars and Stripes, and I’ll show you a man
that loses worse than a bankrupt in the finer
sense of the word.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
</p>
<p>
Without the establishment of homes this
nation can not stand. No matter how frugal
a man is, no matter how economical his habits
you can give him the most promising part
and he can not marry and rear a family because
at every angle he is beaten. What is
he going to do? Free land is almost gone,
food stuffs are high, all his needs are expensive;
how can he make it? Every line he
wishes to enter is crowded! Reason for
yourself and see if this is not true.
</p>
<p>
When you talk of large families, who raises
them but the poor people and this will soon
be eliminated. If the poor man raises one
child he is doing more than his duty to society
than the rich man. The expense is such
a night-mare and horror to a common, ordinary
and honest man to provide the necessaries
of life for his family that I sometimes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
shudder and feel sorry that I caused children
to be born, fought for a home, paid my debts,
and lived clean. I wouldn’t want to do it
again for my country, and I love her as I do
the man of Galilee.
</p>
<p>
I fear America is no longer another word
for opportunity as was said by the beloved
Emerson, unless she helps him to establish
homes on the public domain by loaning him
money at a low rate on long time periods and
keep him at work and help him along and not
foreclose when he is doing his best to win.
He’ll win, give him a chance.
</p>
<p>
What Emerson said may have been true at
an earlier period it was so intended, but the
plan was lost sight of and the great greed for
wealth was accomplished to the detriment of
the majority who have been obliged to make
their living with their hands. It is a sad fact
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
but true that there is a revolution slowly
kindling in the breasts of the laboring class
of people against capital; God grant that in
some way the fire can be put out.
</p>
<p>
I have sometimes thought what’s the use
of living. The sorrows and pains outnumber
the joys by a large margin. You slip down
the hill of pleasure without any exertion, but
to climb the mountain of morality is a gigantic
task, for every step is a struggle, and
after you have fought and won nine-tenths
of the journey one misstep and you slip to
the bottom and the whole climb is before you
again. It’s fight, fight all the time, continually
and forever! It robs you of nature’s
rest, steals away your ambition, stirs up hatred
towards those in easy circumstances and
causes conditions of unrest and strife.
</p>
<p>
Is life worth the gigantic struggle to overcome the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
perplexing difficulties and endeavor
to live honest and clean and not slip down
the path of despair where the great majority
seem to be going. I say it is! “For, what do
you profit if you gain the whole world and
lose your own soul.”
</p>
<p>
Let your mind ponder over the story of
Lazarus picking up the crumbs from the
rich man’s table and you must conclude the
starving beggar gained uncomparable joy
and satisfaction to the rich man’s torment
when the two men’s lives were carefully
weighed on the scales where God predominates
and not the sugar trust. It pays! It
pays in a thousand different ways!
</p>
<p>
There is something to a man that lives an
upright life in the church and in the world.
He is a valued asset to any community, he
may be poor but he has character, and this is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
something money can not buy. It takes a
good life to make a man. A fellow that is
rich and lives solely for the pleasure of his
money is not a man.
</p>
<p>
One time I mused thus: If it could be so,
just for the shortest duration of time, while
temptation was the strongest and the fierce
conflict was raging, if I could be blind, absolutely
blind till the strong temptation had
passed and then let me see again and have
my first sight catch the last glimpse of the
golden sun as it dipped behind the western
horizon, leaving behind a long stream of
golden beauty stretching out in its grandeur
to kiss the evening sky; even if a scene like
this could erase the temptation and the blindness
prevail during the surging of the conflict,
how could my faith be increased by not
having the moral courage and strength of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
character to withstand the evil? It’s the
casting aside of temptation by the sheer
strength of the will power that makes the
struggle easier, the way grow brighter, and
the victories grander. If God would allow
such a condition once, we, in our weakness,
might ask again and again and instead of
growing stronger we would grow weaker. It
is the heroic fighter who has won his laurels
when the bullets of evil whizzed all around
him that you like to go up to and pin the
medal on.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span><a name='ch05' id='ch05'></a>THE SADNESS BEHIND THE VALE.</h2>
<p>
A life of self-denial and sacrifice is the
grandest object the sun shines on. There is
nothing under the azure skies of heaven so
worthy of true merit as the pure, unspotted
and unselfish heart of a sacrificing mother.
How my heart aches for the poor, worn and
tired mother whose whole life is confined in
four walls with three or four children, laying
claim to her entire time and attention. You
do not find these kind of women saturated
with society; they are not fanatics on woman
suffrage nor are they riding through the
streets in a limousine with a good-for-nothing
yellow-nosed pup sitting beside them. In common
decency how can any woman with any
affection or mother love center it upon such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
an object as a despicable, worthless pug-nosed
cur. If it was a dog like a Shepherd, St.
Bernard, Newfoundland, and many others,
there would be a little better taste shown,
but when it is confined solely to the mongrel
whelps and Teddy bears I think it is high
time to pick up the Bible and read the thirty-second
chapter of Isaiah from the first to the
twelfth verse inclusive. Lord, but it is pitiful
to see such things committed when there are
thousands and thousands of poor little homeless
girls and boys starving to death for
some one to love them, give them a home and
then see a poodle woman and her poodle dog
go rushing by.
</p>
<p>
For a long number of years I have had the
pleasure of being acquainted with one of
God’s self-denial mothers. If this earth contains
anything sweeter and the next world
anything better the mind of man so far hasn’t
been able to conceive it nor the Bible to reveal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
it. In her early womanhood and all through
her life she has been frail, small-boned, short
of stature, delicate, and very unmuscular.
Her’s was not the physique to struggle as she
has against life’s tremendous battles, but she
took up the burden cheerfully, looked every
difficulty in the face squarely and openly and
lifted her voice to the ever-listening ear and
overcame every obstacle with gentleness and
love. When heartaches, pains and sorrows
seemed so heavy that human endurance could
no longer stand the strain and tension, she
would, through the channels of her wonderful
self-control, step from beneath the heavy
clouds of trials and sorrows out into the sunshine
of God’s holy love and stand master
and conqueror of every trial. The loyal battles
she has swept with victory are worthy
of such praise and eulogy that the human
mind can not find words choice enough to
meet it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
</p>
<p>
Poverty with all its worry can not engulf
her, for she has that faith that there will be
a way provided and she determines, and the
mountain is seen moving in the distance. No
time to partake of many pleasures is her lot;
she must study her every day cares, rear her
children, school, clothe, and provide for them.
Many times a tear stands where joy should
be. It is beyond all understanding why her
cross should be so heavy when every atom of
her strength has been used to make the world
better, but no matter how heavy the load is,
how painful the head might ache, or how discouraging
the teacher, the present every day
conditions must be met and the sooner begun
the sooner ended. Every minute is occupied
or the accumulation of wasted time makes the
burden heavier.
</p>
<p>
The hands work and the mind works.
Neither can rest and accomplish the needs,
and while the hands iron and bake and wash,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
the mind is occupied on what the hungry
mouths demand, and how an old coat or vest
or an under garment can be made into an
article of service.
</p>
<p>
These are the kind of women worth while;
these are the kind that more than do their part
in sustaining a great government. Her lot is
not a pleasant one, but she hands down to
posterity a better and more substantial foundation
for better government than any class
of women in our nation; her life is an open
book where the entries are made on each day’s
pages. On page after page you can see where
the tears have fallen, where the struggle has
been so keen and bitter that hope had almost
fled; but turn the page and you will find
renewed hope. The ever-listening ear has
heard the words bathed in grief and the answer
came, “Blessed are they that mourn for
they shall be comforted.” How a few dollars
from some good-hearted philanthropist would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
ease the way for this poor little struggling
woman. Why is it when she has reached the
point in life where she should expect the most
the least is at hand? She has passed the
thirty-eighth mile post, with the odds strongly
against her. The system is torn down more
rapidly than it can be built up. Everything
seems to combat against her and endeavor to
overwhelm her, but sorrows, discouragements,
trials, hardships and heartaches with their
utmost collective strength have not been sufficient
to thwart or encompass her. Every one
has been defeated, the cost has been gigantic,
it has stooped her shoulders, chiseled deep
creases in her brow and cast snow among her
locks, robbed her of comforts due her and
strewn old age where youth should be. The
sad face still smiles and with an unconceivable
determination she meets every foe in the great
battle field of life and crushes them.
</p>
<p>
She does it from close application of that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
wonderful story of love that is found in the
fifth chapter of the Gospel of St. Matthew
from the third to the twelfth verses inclusive.
The greatest solace to aching hearts the
world has ever known. The struggle would
have never been met and conquered if she
had depended on her own strength, she
needed a higher source to guide her and in
every struggle the lowly man of Galilee stood
beside her and when the cross became so
heavy that she stumbled and was ready to
fall, his loving arm was ready to shield and
sustain her.
</p>
<p>
With all her pains and trials there came
into her life one night the greatest sorrow of
all, and although the load she had carried far
overtaxed her strength she had to bear another
and heavier one. Her little sweetheart
boy of nearly two years old came toddling in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
one day with the cruel marks of a fatal sickness
on his sweet little face, and after three
days and nights of long vigil the tired mother
laid down to rest, and as she slept on a pillow
bathed with tears the pure little innocent
soul was gathered into the arms of angels
and carried away. Years have passed, but
the pain lingers and when the thoughts go
back to the silent form in the little white casket
the tender heart of this pure woman is
so engulfed in sorrow that it seems it is entirely
beyond all human endurance and patience.
It is then this still, small voice she
has known so long, again speaks and says:
“Come unto me all ye that labor and are
heavy laden and I will give you rest.”

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span><a name='ch06' id='ch06'></a>GRATITUDE.</h2>
<p>
Few people care to listen to your sorrows,
trials and burdens if you are not succeeding.
If you succeed, everybody is grabbing for the
stock no matter how well filled with water
it is. They point with pride at the successful
man as he saunters by; he can do a great
many things that are shady, but on account
of his success and prominence they are
hushed up and never rise above a whisper;
he’s dined and wined; gets cut prices on
everything he consumes; rebates from the
railroads and special privileges in the
churches. But take the poor fellow that each
day’s debts eats up his pay roll and we never
hear of his fine qualities until we read his
obituary.
</p>
<p>
If you will take a few leisure moments and
look up the meaning of the word “gratitude,”
you will find that there are few words that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
surpass it in quality, love and kindness. It
clusters near the soul and is properly a virtue.
In this life it is very hard to be misunderstood
and undervalued by those we
love, but this too in the journey from the
cradle to the grave we must learn to bear
without a murmur, for it’s a tale often repeated.
</p>
<p>
Any one who has given their time, talent
and attention serving the dear people, either
as a Town Trustee, member of the School
Board, Mayor, or any of the petty offices of
small towns and villages, used his best judgment
in endeavoring to meet every issue
honestly, fairly and squarely, wins for his
gratuitous services the everlasting displeasure
of his constituents.
</p>
<p>
No matter how hard you strive or how
honest you may be there come up little intricate issues
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
where there is no middle course
and no matter what stand you take some people
charge you with graft and dishonest motives.
Any one who can serve for one term
and is so unfortunate and foolish as to accept
another, has acquired a character so colored
that it takes from ten to fifteen years in our
best Sunday Schools to wash out the stains.
</p>
<p>
Don’t ever feel elated or think you are
popular because you are elected and people
call you alderman, for the first thing they
will do will be to slip out that pleasant, sweet
sounding word “Alderman” and put in
“Grafter” with the thumbscrews set. They’d
call you a grafter if they personally
know the treasury had been depleted for fifteen
years. My, the pleasures of a gratis
councilman!
</p>
<p>
I have heard of people losing their minds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
for long intervals and then suddenly regain
them and I have often wondered if they had
been favored with an aldermanic pleasure
and the mind commenced to slip into space,
I wonder if when the cog alderman appeared
if it wouldn’t cause such a jolt that it would
clear the whole mental atmosphere. Perhaps
there is one redeeming feature and if it
wasn’t for some consolation the pictures and
scenes would be so indelibly impressed that
you would be able to recall them long after
you’d said “Amen.”
</p>
<p>
The spirit of revenge and retaliation were
never very deeply imbedded in my make up.
The seed being lightly sown I used the harrow
instead of the cultivator and got it out.
I am glad I did; it has helped me to get a
good night’s rest instead of fondling and caressing
discolored orbs that might have come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
in sudden contact with solid and knotty
obstacles.
</p>
<p>
I bought a small business one time from a
devout Presbyterian; I had the greatest confidence
and trust in him, which I had a sad
right to have. If false colors are carried we
must find it out because they carry no notice
to warn us. Well, anyway, he spread the
tempting menu of his careful preparation in
great shape. He was pleasant, courteous and
very entertaining. The way he figured
up the invoice you’d thought mathematics
was his specialty. His tongue kept pace with
his pencil and after everything was figured
up he brought up the “Bonus Good Will”
part and I really thought he was letting me
do him a favor by giving him one hundred
iron men. You see I wanted his good will
along with everybody else’s.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
I am glad I learned about this “Good Will”
business. All told “Good Will” and “Bonuses”
have cost me nine hundred and thirty-three
dollars thirty-three and a third cents.
Don’t try to fool me on “Good Wills” again;
they’re a drug on the market, very unsaleable
and unpopular to your humble servant.
</p>
<p>
After I paid the “Good Will” price and
everything was agreeably settled I started in
with my maiden business. Going through
the bags and some other stuff in the back
room a few days afterwards, I discovered
bags invoiced and paid for at one hundred
pounds shy. “Shy,” I said, and he a Christian!
This taught me that there are eighty
and ninety pound Christians. The loud
smelling, decaying and life moving gunny
sacks contained prepared meats for poultry.
I quit in disgust and went into the front department;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
a fellow stepped in and said, “How
is business?” and I answered “Rotten.” A
frank acknowledgment of a painful truth.
</p>
<p>
Other things ran about the same; the
horses were sold as unblemished, sound as a
dollar, etc., and mind you, he a Christian and
ministers dropping in every few days and
talking and planning how to increase the
congregation. My, I’m glad I used that harrow!
When I sold out the business, I
marked down experiences one thousand dollars.
I felt pretty blue after I had lost the
thousand bones I worked hard to get, and
it used to be when I got the blues I eased
my mind with graveyard poetry; pardon me
for inserting it here.

<p>
A friend came to me one time and said he
was in pressing financial straits and asked me
to loan him fifteen dollars for two weeks. I
granted the request and the loan was made.
I thought I was familiar with the calendar
and knew when two ordinary weeks ended,
but those two weeks were the longest I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
ever known. Fortnight after fortnight
passed and no end came. Long and endless
weeks of this kind might be all right for the
man facing the electric chair, but they had no
solace for an individual anxious to get married
and needing the husky “Simoleans” to
furnish a cage for his waiting bird.
</p>
<p>
One day I met the overdue biped and I
said, “How about it?” I was young then and
I thought I could glide in as easy this way as
well as any phrase I had in my limited vocabulary.
“Well,” he said, “I’ll tell you what
I’ll do. I know you are about to plunge in
the matrimonial sea and I have a proposition
to offer you. I have a good standard
make of organ that I don’t need and if you
will give me forty-five dollars and forget
about that previous fifteen we will call the
transaction closed and drop the curtain.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
</p>
<p>
“All right,” I said, “here is your money.”
</p>
<p>
That organ may not be in existence yet,
but it’s in my memory fresh as ever. I
couldn’t play it, for it was all I could do to
carry a tune when it was tied in a bag. I
had no wife to play it and I couldn’t keep it
and get married, I was in a desperate condition
one day when I walked into a hardware
store, that is a store, you know, where they
keep ware that is hard, frying pans, dish
pans, bread pans, etc., you know what those
things are for. “Well,” I said to the village
wit behind the case, “I’ll trade you that organ
for enough household paraphernalia to cook
with, take care of enough viands and stuff
or whatever you call it, to keep two people
about to start out together; each now separate
and apart but very anxious to be united.”
“Agreed,” he said, “hand over that list
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
you’ve got with the articles on and I’ll have
them ready in a short time.”
</p>
<p>
Funny, isn’t it, how the wind is tempered
to the shorn lamb, but how about the one
ready to be shorn when there isn’t even a
zephyr blowing. Well, the deal was transacted,
exchange made, and that is how I got my
household goods when I married dearie.
The financial report read like this: Actual
cash in organ, sixty dollars; actual worth,
forty-five dollars; second actual value in organ,
forty-five dollars; actual value of pots
and pans twenty-five dollars, experience and
pleasure of making a two weeks’ loan, thirty-five
dollars. This was not putting a premium
on “Bliss” for a fellow just getting ready to
carry the matrimonial load.

The weight would have been some lighter
if that weasened faced Dutchman had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
worked off on me a left handed frying pan
for a right-handed bride, and was so extremely
liberal on the good deal he had made
that he threw in a second hand mouse trap
when the new ones sold six for a dime. This
was the first time I saw tears in my wife’s
eyes. The fountain was opened and they
flowed freely. Those tears were trivial to
the tears we’ve in shed later life, but those
first tears moved me to almost unconsolable
grief and the emotion caused a flow of poetry.
It’s not very long and will not tire you much,
so I will slip it in here as a filler.

When I was a County Clerk and exceedingly
busy pushing the quill over the big records,
a M. E. Minister came in one day and
accosted me with that word that arouses confidence.
Brother, he said, we are figuring on
a short order annex to the church, (remember
that word SHORT?) and we, of course,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
couldn’t slight you and if you will kindly donate
as liberally as possible the Lord will bless
you abundantly, for you know he loves a
cheerful giver, and etc., and etc. Well, I responded.
When you get your subscription list
in these parts drop in and I will help you.
</p>
<p>
I know what an annex to some of the
churches without or with cook stove means.
It seems nowadays, as the prophecies are
being filled, some churches deem it necessary to
feed the stomach before the soul, realizing, I
presume, a full stomach is a twin brother to
a big heart. They beg the food and the utensils
to serve it in from uncheerful givers and
then dispense it cautiously and sparingly, the
more sparingly the more money for the Lord.
When the ice cream is served they forget all
about scriptural measure of “Heaped up and
running over” and run it under. If one dish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
of scriptural measure can be stretched into
four dishes of worldly measure, there is forty
cents instead of ten. High finance, you see!
I’ve often thought a society of this kind that
would squeeze down the measure on ice cream
procured at a minimum cost, would bear
watching if they were running a milk wagon
with a pump near. If any one else gets money
in this way they call it an unearned increment.
What would Jesus call it? I really
would be afraid to express my thoughts at
that kind of a meeting for fear they’d request
the parcel post.
</p>
<p>
In a few days the brother dropped in and
hoisted from his inside pocket the subscription
list and handed it to me. I glanced over
it casually, as is natural in such cases made
and provided, to see who were the cheerful
givers. After concluding what I thought was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
a liberal donation and really beyond what a
man of my means should give I put down
forty dollars and handed the paper back to
him. The ungentlemanly gentleman took it
and looked at it and said, “Well, we expected
much better than this from you.” You know
what feelings ebb and flow within you when
you get a snub like this. I could feel the
Irish blood chasing the English blood at a
hazardous speed, but I said nothing and was
glad again of the early use of that harrow.

<p>
That’s Sallie over there in that potato
patch. She has been endeavoring to tease
from mother earth enough tubers to supply
the family through a long winter. Nature in
this and many other instances has been unkind.
The rain waited too long and the one
supply of food that fills so large a place are
small as marbles, nevertheless this dear soul
laboriously gathered them and is carrying
them, pail at a time, and storing them away
for a long, cold winter. Though the tubers
are small and puny, she has a way of cooking
them with such marked success that they
would tickle the palate of a king and he’d be
passing his plate the second time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
</p>
<p>
Sal does the housework, the buying of supplies,
cares for the chickens, plants the garden,
does the sewing, picks up the paint brush
when necessary, and does about everything
that anyone can do. She is past fifty years
of age, most of them hard and bitter years.
They have not been the kind of years where
the goal has been worth the trials and bitterness.
The streaks of silver are beginning to
show in her dark hair, she is small in physique,
clean limbed, lithe, resourceful, determined,
and intelligent. Her schooling in the
practical side of life is an attainment any one
should be proud of. She is one of the most
wiry and courageous women that has ever
lived such a grand and noble life and kept
the sad, dreary and lonely part locked up in
her unselfish heart.
</p>
<p>
Behold her as she is, one of God’s purest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
gifts! Her life is clean, wholesome and
grand and of such a sweetness and beauty
that mocks to scorn any imitation of the artist.
For eight long years she has cared uncomplainingly
for the aged, widowed mother
as her almost sole benefactor of aid and cheer
in the home. She has sacrificed, schemed,
planned, worked, and struggled in a way that
is worthy of our greatest financiers, diplomats,
or statesmen. She has fought within
her own heart far greater battles and carried
away the victory to a more deserving reward
than many a soldier on the battlefield. She
has denied herself in order that she might
give the fullest measure of devotion to a dear
old mother who is slipping slowly, slowly to
that great home of rest and comfort.
</p>
<p>
God bless you, Sallie, in your old age, when
the silver streaks no longer glisten in your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
hair and it is all turned to the whiteness and
purity of snow; when your poor, tired aching
limbs from their long years of toil no longer
yield to quick response, when time chisels its
deep furrows in your brow and your keen
eye loses its lustre and grows dim. I hope
God will reward you with the choicest gifts
of his kingdom, and when the final summons
is made and you stand in the open doorway
of his love, bathed in the purity of the sparkling
dew in the evening time of life, may the
sweetness of your character come wafting
gently in the fulness of its beauty and dwell
amidst all that is holy, sweet and sacred.

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span><a name='ch09' id='ch09'></a>SUNSHINE.</h2>
<p>
In endeavoring to entertain you in this
chapter I wish I might have the wit of a
Nasby or come Nye the Mark; but not having
the brilliant talents of either of these
illustrious wits who cracked the ribs of so
many people I hope you will bear with me
patiently as I proceed to give to you some
rays of sunshine I have been picking up for
the last twenty years from all classes of
people.
</p>
<p>
A fellow said to me one time I’ll tell you a
panacea for every ailment. I have taken it
for years and you don’t need a skilled Pharmacist
to compound it. This was the simple
remedy: Trust in providence and keep your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
bowels open. I thought it was a pretty good
prescription and if applied carefully you would
never have appendicitis or a good many other
complaints. Of course, he said, some people
ask too much of providence. I hardly think
it fair to ask the Lord to furnish you the land,
the patch of potatoes, a pail to put them in,
a spade to dig them with, and then get down
on your knees and in funeral tones tell him
you are out of spuds and would like a mess
for dinner with the jackets off. Don’t ask
too much.
</p>
<p>
It is better to whistle than to groan. It
will make some heart lighter to hear you
whistle than to groan. If you can’t whistle
a tune sizzle something through your teeth,
there’s cheer in it for some one. No matter
how worrisome, difficult or perplexing the
problem is, don’t worry or brood over it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
Whistle if you can, sizzle if you can’t. It
will keep you from getting meloncolic; colic
that comes from something besides eating too
many Colorado watermelons with the accent
strong on the water.
</p>
<p>
I’ve known people whom you’d think from
all appearances they hadn’t a care in the
world, the sunny side was always exposed
and unconsciously they would be dropping
encouraging words, doing kind deeds, lending
acts of assistance, and doing everything
to lessen the other fellow’s burden. They
didn’t tell any one that they didn’t know where
their breakfast was coming from, but somehow
or other they would get hold of some
patent breakfast food and eat it in its native
state if no cow was at hand and then they
were all right until the next meal, luncheon,
I believe is the proper society word.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
</p>
<p>
It never pays to be stingy with eulogies or
encomiums. A little praise has caused many
a breast to heave with gladness and chase
away gloom. The cost is small, thank God
it’s outside of the trusts. So don’t be backward
in using it at every opportunity you
meet. If the sermon is good, go up and tell
the semi-paid man behind the pulpit, it won’t
kill him. He may be surprised, but keep at
it until he gets used to it. If brother or sister
so and so has made a misstep and you are an
unbeliever or not, don’t break your neck in
rushing to your neighbor and ah, ahing it
all over town. Let two thoughts get into
your head at once and let the better thought
prevail, and instead of helping stain the character
of a poor unfortunate, make it your
business to use your good advice, if you
haven’t any then keep still.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
When a church member steps from the
narrow path, why has everybody such a sudden
interest? Why does it cause such a loosening
of tongues? The Bible says, “he that is
without sin among you let him cast the first
stone.” If any one but Jesus was without sin
why not advertise it. Give it to the Post and
use the red letters on the front page. The
way I look at the parable quoted by Jesus is
that if a stone is thrown some one has to
throw it, it may be thrown with intent or
carelessness, but in either event the stone has
been thrown and some one will be struck, so
the best way is not to throw the stone, if you
have to throw something, go into one of the
leagues and then don’t throw a stone. Throw
a baseball, but don’t hit the umpire.
</p>
<p>
Wherever you can place a rose where a
thorn has been, do it. There is both fragrance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
and class to a rose, something sweet, cheerful
and pretty; but the fellow that can find any
redeeming qualities in a thorn is not the person
that can stand inspection. Where could
you put him where he would be an improvement?
You can’t progress unless you make
use of the things progress is found in. Pluck
the rose every time, leave the other alone.
</p>
<p>
Don’t wait ’till it’s time to erect the tombstone
before you pay tribute to your dear
friend. One small flower is worth more to the
living than tons piled on their caskets. Some
poor fellows never get tomb stones, head
stones or anything to mark their graves. How
much better you feel if you have never put a
pebble in any one’s path as an obstruction to
their progress than if you had been rolling
boulders and now see your mistake. You can’t
afford to do it. Pay your little tributes all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
along the journey of life. Be as careful dropping
pains or sorrows as you would dropping
pearls.
</p>
<p>
Don’t wait ’till your father, mother or wife
dies, then lie about them on their tombstones.
You only have one father and one mother; be
careful and think some before you pour out
any derogatory statements or cheap invectives
concerning them. Your wife is entitled to a
great many compliments you never gave her.
The reverential words on the slab in the cemetery
isn’t going to fool any one, and have
them to believe, as you would wish, that you
did the fine thing, when really you are to
blame for stealing from her about twenty
years of her life time. You’ve caused hollow
cheeks where roses should have been and you
stole many pleasures from her and enjoyed
them all by yourself. Too much swine in your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
nature to make people think you were sincere
in your profuse epigram on the tombstone.
</p>
<p>
So many people think they are endowed
with a peculiar and special sort of wisdom
and are able to fool their fellow men so successfully
that they try it on the Lord. Here is
where they make a fatal mistake, for the
Lord certainly knew what he was doing when
he made countenances. The newspaper’s
most clever ads are no comparison to the
clean, open ads the Lord puts on faces and
the clear unfrosted windows where you can
look far into the soul.
</p>
<p>
You can’t break man’s laws without being
detected. If you are a sneak criminal, inebriate,
crook, lascivious, immoral or any other
of the degrading types in the category of a
false man, the warning is openly and clearly
displayed on your countenance. You can’t fly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
false colors and succeed, for sooner or later
you pay the penalty to the last farthing.
When you hear the remark “I don’t like his
looks,” there is something shown in the countenance
to verify the statement or no accusation
would have been made. Be a man and
your face will do the advertising.
</p>
<p>
Don’t be afraid of censure or criticism or
let it keep you from helping the fellow that is
down. God gave us religion for that purpose.
It’s something to use every day in the week
and not a specialty for the Sabbath; the more
you use it the brighter it gets. Anything you
don’t use and keep polished loses its usefulness
and becomes rusty. Use it whenever you
can and you’ll be surprised the confidence you
gain in people’s hearts. It’s the greatest purifier
in the world, that’s why God gave it to us.
He knew what he was doing. It’s the only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
thing in the world that will lift up the fallen
woman, the drunken man, the horse thief, the
blasphemer and all others when every hand is
turned against them. It’s a panacea for every
evil. It’s the only thing that will take humanity
with all their sins after they are entirely
forsaken and down at the threshhold of hell
and make them better. It will take them in
the eleventh hour when they come sneaking in
at the back door with characters stained as
black as night and every law has been transgressed,
but as they plead piteously for forgiveness,
their petition is heard and all their
sins are blotted out and the Lord gives them
another chance. He stoops down in his great
mercy and love and gives them that peace beyond
all understanding. He raises them up
and helps them reach for the cross when no
hand is extended to help them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
At every opportune chance laugh long and
heartily, nothing is better to cheer and comfort,
and while it is doing the other fellow
good you are getting the cheapest medicine
on the market for your digestive organs. Try
it after you eat some boarding house pancakes
an inch think. You have lots of things to
smile for. There is always some one else
worse off than yourself. You see them everywhere.
If you have a large family your neighbor
has a larger one. If you have none at all
pity your neighbor who can’t figure out some
way to get rid of his mother-in-law without
losing his wife. If you are able to hobble
around, have a heart for the fellow in the
wheel chair and the fellow that has to stay
flat on his back and never sees the sun rise.
</p>
<p>
There are two kinds of sunshine; one is
entirely dependent upon the individual and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
other was inaugurated shortly after creation.
Each is necessary to fill the divine plan. While
one kind is periodical in some people, the other
is always at hand unless clouds intervene.
God’s sunshine is unexcelled and is a marvel
in itself for warmth, beauty, cheerfulness and
grandeur. The rising and falling of this wonderful
orbit body is said to start and finish the
work of man, as he was supposed to labor and
scheme from sun to sun.
</p>
<p>
This plan may have been popular and proper
before the day of the multi-millionaire, but
the time is too short for the present day man,
and in order to pay the necessary obligations
to exist the twilight at both ends must be
consumed and then reach in and grab several
hours of darkness. The housewife may have
to sew and rock the baby and prove her contention
that her work is never done, but it’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
up to the Governor, the old man, Dad, or any
other name you may call him, to keep the
flour in the bin, coal in the bucket, shoes on
the children, and an endless number of other
things. He’s the lad that must fix it up with
the banker when the note is renewed. He must
through some devised method dress the kids
in schools as good as his more prosperous
neighbor, or there’s snobs and tears. He must
provide something besides the proverbial soup
bone that one neighbor could borrow from another
through the winter months. He must
buy the latest books, procure lyceum and
chautauqua tickets, pay the preacher, the ice
man, the milk man, the water man, light man,
and dig continually for charity, and thus you
see the sun to sun theory has the bottom torn
out of it.
</p>
<p>
Dad is never still long enough for the birds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
to build nests in his goatee and set three
weeks. If he slackens up you notice a visible
reduction in your pancake pile. The Lord
didn’t make the suns far enough apart for dad
or some other people. I worked for a farmer
one time that used to start out with a handmade
sun about two-thirty A. M. and never
ceased till ten P. M. The meals always bothered
me; I couldn’t tell if it was breakfast the
next morning or two suppers. If God’s sunshine
meets man’s sunshine and the two mix
properly, you’ve got an individual that is a
continual pleasure, one whose existence is exhilarating.
He whistles and sings and smiles
and laughs and gets out of life everything
that is good, and everybody likes and knows
him.

I was never so ashamed in my life as I was
one time when I had encased in my left cheek
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
a quid of tobacco the size of a hen’s egg. I
was carrying on nonchalantly a conversation
with a depot master, and the saliva was gathering
so rapidly, it wasn’t long before I could
only grunt. I always disliked to ruin a floor
with expectoration and was also embarrassed
by the presence of the agent’s boy, a little
fellow of four years, but my mouth was so
full and my cheeks so inflated that leakage
was starting and I was forced to eject it or
swallow it. I chose the former and let it go.
It sounded like the distant booming of guns
and the space required to contain it on the
floor was unbelievable. If its dimensions
didn’t cover a foot square outside of the innumerable
rivulets in every direction, I’ll buy
my wife a twelve dollar Easter bonnet for a
Christmas present. The little boy looked at it
and said, “My, that’s a big one!” I sneaked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
out crestfallen, abashed and ashamed, but
didn’t have the sense to quit for some years
afterwards, when the preacher said something
about the ashes to ashes and dust to dust.

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span><a name='ch10' id='ch10'></a>TEMPERANCE.</h2>
<p>
The cause of temperance is one that has
been close to my heart for twenty years.
Taken from the logical standpoint of protection
to the home, sound saneness, improvement
in morals, an enhancement of citizenship,
it is the second paramount issue of the
age. Take away liquor, stop the traffic entirely,
and you reduce seventy-five per cent of
crime. The empty whisky-bottle is the greatest
curse that ever existed. When it is
standing filled in front of some bar-room
mirror, it is harmless, but when it is empty
it signifies that it has been drank by somebody
and has been the direct cause for all that has
followed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
</p>
<p>
Trace it up and you will find sorrow, misery,
heartaches, remorse, disgrace, shame, humiliation,
want, poverty, destroyed homes,
cruelty, hatred, anger, revenge, and murder.
Rags, vulgarity, dishonor, wasted lives, and
deceit. Ruined sweethearts, broken-hearted
wives, disgraced parents, and hungry, shoeless
children. Disease, filth, white slavery,
prize fights, tangoes, rottenness, and shame.
Keeley cures, jails, penitentiaries, poorhouses,
brothels, cabarets, and insane asylums.
Thieves, robbers, safe blowers, beggars, pick-pockets,
delirium tremors, and death. Leave it
alone!
</p>
<p>
Some people say there is no harm in it;
there isn’t if you leave it alone. You can take
a loaded revolver and lay it alongside of a
well-filled whisky bottle and they will get
along side by side peacefully as long as time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
exists. Each one separate and apart are harmless;
but let a sane man come along and drink
the whisky, pick up the revolver, and what
happens? Every nationality without distinction
to race or color, Irishmen included, will
run for safety.

<p>
A well-educated young man with brilliant
prospects, neatly attired, attractive, and of
fine, honorable parentage, was passing a saloon
one day when a friend standing in the
doorway invited him in. He had never been
in a place of this kind in his life. His parents
had taught him, friends advised him, and a
sweet faced girl had warned him. Conscience
told him to decline and go on, but, like millions
of others, he heeded the invitation and
stepped in. “Come up and take something,”
the tempter said. “No,” he said, “I never
drink.” “Come on,” urged the tempter. “It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
won’t hurt you.” “NO,” he said; “it’s beneath
the dignity of a true gentleman and it
would break my mother’s heart.” “Ah, come
on, don’t be a kid,” he urged, and still the boy
said no. After continued and repeated solicitation
he finally yielded and drank his first
glass.
</p>
<p>
Alas, the fatal mistake was made. Years of
careful training were swept aside. Hopeful
aspirations of his mother when she looked on
his innocent face in the cradle were all for
naught. Solemn advice from a kind father
was lost sight of, and the deed was done.
That first drink fired his brain. Others were
taken and his eyes shone, the house treated,
and the once quiet, manly lad was loud and
boisterous. Self-respect was cast aside and
foul utterances flew fast and thick from a
once clean mouth. The end came. He reeled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
in drunkenness and fell to the floor in a gibbering
drunken stupor. He was put to bed
and when sober he felt the shame and remorse
so keenly that he was at the point of self destruction.
He thought of his mother, his
father, the dear little sweetheart, and his
friends. He was so afraid they would all hear
of his ignominy that he kept secluded. He
couldn’t bear to face them, tell all and start
anew.
</p>
<p>
The humiliation was more than he could
stand and he slipped farther and farther down
the steep and rapid descent to hell. Back in
his cheerful and once comfortable home a
dear old mother sat waiting and watching
year after year the lamp was kept burning. A
kind old father sat with bowed head thinking
and thinking. A dear little girl was weeping
and weeping, and still he didn’t come. Where,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
O where was he and why didn’t he come?
Alas! how sad as he sank lower and lower.
Drunken brawls were common, nights spent
in revelry very often; the dissipation was
telling, his once clean countenance was haggard.
His step was languid, lethargy was
settling upon him, and his whole being was
repulsive. His character was no longer clean
and a thing of beauty. Brothels caught him
and God’s penalties were discernible for the
violation of his laws. Decent men shunned
him and pure women scorned him, but still
the light was kept burning. The mother
watched, the father waited, the sweetheart
prayed, and the friends yearned; but down,
down, down he went. Even dogs hurried by
him, the filth and disease was nauseating.
</p>
<p>
The years sped quickly and there he is
clear down at the bottom, an object of disgust
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
and scorn. Behold him, beneath the mass of
stale and putrid slime, a castoff, friendless and
penniless vagabond. Beneath the most loathsome
and foul degeneracy conceivable; even
beneath the filthy sewer. He lay on a bundle
of rags in a drunkard’s hut. As he moaned
and groaned, an old friend passing by heard
him, stepped in and stood looking at him.
With tears streaming down his cheeks the boy
looked up and said, “my life is ebbing, I am
at the border line, my career is wasted; I am
a drunken, despised and worthless sot, friendless
and alone. I can see nothing ahead but
the blackest despair. Oh my poor old mother,
my poor old father, my dear little sweetheart,
My Sav—oh—oh.” Another spell grasped
him and as he tossed and shrieked and
moaned, grappling with the demon, writhing
in mental anguish, terror clouded his countenance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
his eyes rolled, his limbs jerked, the
mouth dropped open, the tongue protruded, he
clutched until the blood trickled from the torn
flesh, a loud, gurgling, terrifying scream, and
he was dead. Died with the delirium tremens
caused by the rum demon. As the old friend
wiped away the tears and stood looking at his
pitiful form he noticed in one of his torn and
ragged pockets a slip of paper. He pulled it
out and read:

How can America, the foremost nation of
the world, that has long boasted of liberty
and advancement, allow the liquor traffic
to continue when the condition it causes are
so critical. It is stealing away her brains,
increasing her crime, lowering her moral
standing, demoralizing her citizenship, and
giving to posterity a weaker race and causing
such poverty, misery and unhumanitarian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
distress. Can this enlightened nation afford
its continuance and let it remain when it has
a grasp so powerful that it is endangering its
very vitals? Can America, with her unsurpassed
institutions of learning, her brilliant
and scholarly statesmen, her great mineral and
agricultural wealth yet unfound and developed,
allow a traffic so alarmingly demoralizing
as to let her constitutional principles
decline? Can she sit still, under her broad
and world famed methods of progress, and
allow such a traffic, that devastates from
every source, for a revenue wrung from
women’s tears, that is so rapidly depreciating
her citizenship. Is she prudent? Is she applying
the Christian principles of her constitution
to obtain revenue from a traffic so
nefarious and debauching? If she realizes
the danger ahead why delay an amendment
that enhances citizenship and principle.

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span><a name='ch12' id='ch12'></a>GLIMPSES FROM THE PAST.</h2>
<p>
I most humbly beg your pardon for inserting
here a short address to a Republican
Convention when I was aspiring to the
office of County Clerk for the second term.
The chairman having instructed the secretary
of the convention to cast the entire
vote of the delegation for myself, I addressed
the convention as follows:
</p>
<p>
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the Convention:
Accept my profound thanks for
the splendid manifestation of honor that
you have conferred upon an humble individual
like myself. I wish to impress upon
you the political principles I outlined to
you briefly two years ago, are the same today as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
were then. I would rather be
defeated honorably, squarely and honestly
than to be successful with a tarnished character
obtained through disreputable methods.
I realize, as do all intelligent reasoners
withholding myself to be the humblest
among you, that character is something
that is not acquired while we sleep. It is a
constant every day struggle, a life-long battle.
Take away our character and what
have we left.
</p>
<p>
I desire to say to you gentlemen that during
my lifetime I have been intimately acquainted
with labor in its most aggressive
form. I know what it is to stand between
two shining bands of steel under a scorching
July sun. I know what it is to stack hay under
a sultry and oppressive heat. I know the
loneliness and privations that comes to one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
who has tended stock in the heart of the
Rocky Mountains. I fully realize that these
different pursuits require grit and determination,
they are the hardest kind of labors, but
I can say to you in all candor that I have
never worked harder in my life than in the
past two years endeavoring to serve the citizens
of this county in the capacity of clerk.
</p>
<p>
If I have been competent, if I have been
faithful, if I have done my duty, that is not
for me to decide. You are the judges of these
conditions, if you think I have, then I ask
for your support and influence. You are a
body of men from all parts of this county; if
each one of you will work for the best interests
of the party I see no reason why we
should not be successful at the polls. The
campaign this year is short; I wish to say for
myself that I will not be able to get around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
much. The duties of my office for the past
six weeks have been very strenuous and will
continue so to be for some time to come. The
state board of equalization were late in sending
their report and not only being late, but
were unkind, and raised the valuation on several
of our taxable properties and this makes
extra work for the clerk, so I trust you will
be like the turkey in the tall tree and keep one
eye open for the boy from Lodge Pole.
</p>
<p>
There has happened in my short career as
an American citizen a good many things that
I have felt elated over and proud of. I am
proud that I am an American citizen, born
under the stars and stripes and belong to a
nation second to none. I am proud I was
born in a state whose brow is bathed by the
mighty Missouri and upon whose bosom flourishes
the most productive crop of the union.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
But if there is one thing that I am prouder of
more than any other, it is the fact that I belong
to a party whose motto is principle and
good government, and whose loftiest aim has
always been to make America the ideal nation
of the world. I thank you.
</p>
<p>
I will here relate an incident that happened
when I first encountered experience in her
knee breeches, I have termed it a fighting, explosive
nauseating cough remedy. I would
prefer calling it an egg nogg; but there is one
extra ingredient that disfranchises the egg
and in a peculiar way leaves the nogg there
in a somewhat embarrassing condition.
</p>
<p>
When I was a youth, I had some peculiar
traits in my makeup. My main instruction
was received from that old professor, experience,
and day by day I gained some valuable
knowledge in the school of hard knocks. Being of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
a peculiar turn of mind I had implicit
truth and confidence in all mankind, and on
account of this trait I have often met with
misplaced confidence.
</p>
<p>
For instance, the “Bonuses” and “Good
Wills” heretofore related. I had contracted a
bad cold of tenacious irritability down near
the little hamlet of Paxton, Nebraska, while
performing the menial labor of an every day
workman on the renowned line of the Union
Pacific. The work being accomplished was
known as bucking steel. Through climatic
conditions of contraction and expansion the
rails on one side had gained from nine to
twelve feet over the rails in the other side.
The side that was ahead was being pulled
back to the point opposite the other by a locomotive
attached to a large cable. Some said
this strategic work swelled the premium of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
the water soaked stock; but this contention is
left to philosophers and those who study economic
problems, as to whether or not the corporation
was ahead rails at Omaha or short at
Ogden.
</p>
<p>
The days were exceedingly warm, it being
in the autumn of the year. I lost more perspiration
than was due me and along toward
evening, when old sol was getting ready to
retire and also largely due to a scant wardrobe,
a chilliness would steal over my spare
physique. The ride home from the work in
the evening, on flat cars, at a hurried speed,
caused the night air to condense in the locality
of the throat. Nature not doing her part, I
tried to assist her in removing the obstruction
and, as soon as the speed of the train would
allow, I shot from the car in a mad race for
the boarding house. Being sure footed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
fleet, I was generally first at the wash basin,
erasing from my countenance Nebraska’s productive
soil and leaving what the water didn’t
loosen on the old fashioned long rolling boarding
house towel. These repeated conditions
day after day commenced to tell and the
slight cold became a hacking cough that embraced
more forcibly than a Dutch lassie
reared on eastern corn.
</p>
<p>
After the work was completed, the men
were returned to the various localities. Upon
arriving safely at my destination, I went to
the home physician. “Doc” when not incarcerated
in the county bastile for dispensing a
compound familiarly known as whiskey but
better known to home residents as hades
corked up in a bottle, prescribed, from his oft
water stock. (I pause for a scalding sensation
felt on my cheeks.) Poor Old “Doc” is
sleeping beneath the sod.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
</p>
<p>
Constant concoctions bringing no relief, I
was at last listening to a well meant prescription
from my co-laborer Dick. He said his
remedy would give unwavering satisfaction to
ailments like mine. I don’t think his remedy
would stand the pure food law test; but when
you get to clutching you’ll clutch anything. So
I listened to the unlearned pharmacist and
keenly assented and he started to compound
two well known ingredients in equal parts.
One ingredient was controlled by that magnetic
dollar chaser, John D., and the other
was controlled by nobody, it did the controling,
i. e., oil and whiskey. I’d cover up this
last ingredient and give it a better concealed
classical standing but ignorance is bliss and
there you are. This carefully prepared drink,
my friend said, should be taken five minutes
before breakfast. So according to directions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
I hoisted the tin cup and down went the fluids.
Just enough oil in it to make it slip quick, and
you had it before you really knew it.
</p>
<p>
It is now twenty-three years since I swallowed
that conglomeration and I can’t hardly
pass a home one-gallon kerosene can full or
empty without a keen desire to kick the bottom
out of it, but you have to be careful with
other people’s property, whether it’s mortgaged
or not. No matter how keen or fertile
your imagination may be you can’t realize a
dose of this character unless you taste it.
Take the minutest equal parts of each, mix
them, drink them and be convinced. Was I
sick? Of all the great guns of all our wars,
Civil or uncivil, I will take my oath before
any judge of common jurisdiction, sitting as
a court of record and say I WAS.
</p>
<p>
The only recollection I have of the breakfast menu
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
was the two hard boiled eggs and a
faint remembrance, as I was leaving the table,
of a fruit picture on the wall tipping up and
down. That was the first time I ever saw
anything inanimate acting so. Mercy, the
taste of that oil and the remembrance of it,
mixing in a place the size of your fist! Think
of that rip-roaring, sizzling tobacco flavored,
ingredient, trying to slip one over on that
kerosene and knock out those two hard-boiled,
well matured, boarding-house eggs. I say in
all candor, I don’t blame John D. for watering
the oil. Water it more, John, it will be
milder to take. I went through the oil belt
in Indiana, Texas, Oklahoma, and all the rest,
I visited all the stills, illicit, and otherwise of
Kentucky, Tennessee, and Colorado; and as
soon as brother Pat could get me to my room
and my head out of the window I hoisted the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
hottest fluids and food stuffs ever contained
in the stomach of man or beast. I have always
felt sorry for those eggs on account of their
age.
</p>
<p>
I must take a short glimpse here of a
peculiar incident that transpired under my
roof between two men of the cloth. One
was a M. E. minister and the other a seven
day advent. The advent had been staying in
town for several weeks and I became fairly
well acquainted with him and his estimable
wife, and he asked me if they might have a
few meetings at our home in the evenings,
and I said certainly and he came. Both he
and his wife were scholars, well cultured and
refined and we enjoyed listening to their version
of the scriptures. How the M. E. minister
came to be there one evening is still a
mystery to me, but I think some one of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
parishioners must have told him that Satan
had entered our home and he had better intervene
and see if he couldn’t extricate us
from the wary gentleman’s clutches.
</p>
<p>
The evening entertainment was progressing
nicely and the advent man was in charge
of the machinery, when suddenly the M. E.
man took issue with him over his version of
one of the scriptural passages and quick wit
and repartee was fast and furious. The advent
was the superior in scriptural knowledge
and the way he got the other fellow in the
meshes and so completely tangled him up is
an event that can never be erased from my
memory. The M. E. man was nonplussed, red
of face and angry; and so ungentlemanly as
to let all the fireworks in his dignified Sunday
nature explode and told the cool, calm advent
that teachings of his kind should be in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
hell. You may lay this excitement to anger,
being worsted, or anything you like, but I
think the gentleman he came to remove from
our home entered him one hundred per cent
strong. Why he was on his feet with his
Methodist fists clenched, ready to fight, and
if it hadn’t been for the soothing, pacifying
utterances of his good wife saying, “John,”
“John,” I don’t know what would have happened.
The other fellow laughed at him and
I really think if the worst had occurred he
would have given the angry man a fuller
meaning of the Bible and turned the other
cheek.
</p>
<p>
I think if an Advent says Saturday is the
Lord’s day and should be observed on the
Sabbath, the Methodist says Sunday is the
day, and some other denomination says Friday
is the day, I’m willing to be convinced. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
beats having the Fourth of July come on
Saturday, and if I had enough money so I
needn’t work I’d say let seven different denominations
have seven different days, and
no matter which home I observed I wouldn’t
be left out shivering in an undershirt. Something
peculiar about church denominations,
all of them headed for the same place, but
each one anxious to route you. One tells you
they have the old travelled road, founded on
the Bible, another a different way, founded on
the Bible, and others another different way,
also founded on the Bible. I conclude the
best and surest way is to be a Christian and
read the Bible, live it and let God show the
way. Sunday churches or Saturday churches
carry no guarantee that you’ll reach Heaven.
</p>
<p>
Before I invested in “Good-wills” and
“Bonuses” and other losing investments, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
would occasionally take my family for a little
trip on the Los Angeles limited and rub
against the aristocracy and the diamonds.
Years before when I was a day laborer on
the same road over which this elegant train
glides, I thought to travel on such a goddess
of beauty was a luxury only for wealth and
culture, and a pleasure unequaled, but hope
beats eternal in the human breast and as I had
lived largely on hope for over thirty years, I
finally said hope can go to blazes, the opportunity
is here and why not embrace it.
</p>
<p>
Well, it is certainly a big taste of wealth
and affluence to settle in cushions a foot deep
with all the wrinkles eradicated for once in
a lifetime by a well filled stomach of the
choicest viands in the culinary art. And oh
the lofty thoughts as you settle down in the
deep upholstery and listen to the clicking of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
the rails as you speed away on this overland
beauty. There is a peculiar feeling under
your vest as you notice the well groomed
man, the well groomed woman, the sparkle of
the electric lights and the glitter of the diamonds.
Elegance everywhere. The very
height of ingenuity. Then when you enter
the dining car with its rosewood finish, tastily
decorated tables, superb linen, and cast
your eye over the choice menu and have the
black gentry all attention and ready to care
for your smallest want, you may feel as I
did, pretty classy company for a boy from
Lodge Pole. Of course there are snubs here
and there, you find them everywhere. They
are in a class that is well known for nineteen
hundred years. They took the leading part
in the crucifixion of the Nazarene. We can’t
exist without having them, and if you will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
notice in any walk of life, there is a pain for
nearly every pleasure, with corns and bunions
thrown in.
</p>
<p>
As a hunter I never received any distinction
and am forced to admit as such I am an
entire nonentity and failure. My father
owned a rifle which was the only one of its
kind in our community for years and years.
Its early history I am unfamiliar with and
never learned it. It was in his possession
when I was born and I suppose it was the
gun he carried on the hand car for protection
when the Indians were numerous in the
latter sixties. At some time it received a
broken stock and ever after its being repaired
it was known as old splice. For many years
when the old year died and the new year was
born, old splice spoke forth at its birth and
its missile of death generally lodged in the
tail of the railroad wind mill.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
Old splice was the type of one hundred
years ago, when people weren’t killed as
quickly as today, the loading was slow and
gave one chance to escape; I remember
brother Pat used it to shoot a dog that he
had tied up with a rope. He took steady aim,
pulled the old fashioned hammer and fired.
When the smoke cleared away the dog was
running with the fullest capacity of its limbs.
The ball had cut the rope.
</p>
<p>
I never shot old splice but once and I’ll always
remember the incident. A chicken
hawk had been tormenting the poultry for a
long time and I got bold and reckless one day,
grabbed old splice (some one had been kind
enough to leave it loaded) and sallied forth
bent on destruction. The hawk was soaring
high in the air but didn’t seem to want to
descend any. Old splice was supposed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
carry half a mile and as I knew this was not
the distance from the gun to the hawk, I concluded
to test out old splice and see if the
prowess of the old fellow had been exaggerated.
I had heard some one say you must
get down on one knee, as an attitude of respect,
I presume, and hold the stock solidly
and lovingly against the shoulder. I did
both of these things and fired. I felt my
head strike the ground so amazingly quick
and hard that it confused and startled me. I
knew I was committing no crime and couldn’t
account for such harsh treatment. At first I
thought the bird might have struck me in the
face and, it coming from such a height, would
cause a terrible compact when one body met
another, but I abandoned this idea, as no
hawk was anywhere above or below. Then
I thought I might have torn some planet loose,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
but this was an asylum idea also. Then I
thought some one may have overfed old
splice and made him bilious. I afterwards
learned this was true. The miscreant still
lives.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span><a name='ch13' id='ch13'></a>HOPES THAT EXPLODED.</h2>
<p>
If it wasn’t for the word hope this would
be a dreary world for the fellow who plans
and builds in the future. It rises and falls in
every human breast. Some have an over
abundance, and others lack in not having
enough. It arouses buoyancy and encouragement
to see one who reaches toward hope and
almost succeeds but doesn’t get quite a firm
enough grip to fasten the goal securely before
he has to let go; but no matter how hard the
fall, or how often, he’s up and trying again.
Discouragement or complete failure never
causes a faltering step or gets time to fester
with despondency before keener activity revives
the energy and the shattered hope is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
rehabilitated and again swells the breast so
full there is nothing to do but try again.
Bless the hopeful man or woman. Some can’t
stand the fall, they go down clear to the bottom.
Defeat and despondency chain them
fast.
</p>
<p>
In the year 1896 when Bryan was preparing
his famous oration “The Crown of Gold”
that was so ably delivered and well received
and which was the leading factor in opening
up the road for him to the White House, I
commenced scheming and planning on patentable
ideas. Nineteen years of hard thinking
has brought no visible financial returns and
so far the patent attorney is the only one who
has received toll. I never entered the field
thinking I had any latent ingenuity like Edison,
Westinghouse, Ford and many others;
but I had hopes, as long as I could pay the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
attorney and the filing fee of the patent office.
</p>
<p>
My first application for a patent was an
adjustable track wrench that met complete
failure after a year’s pendency. I thought I
had a good, practical, economical, and convenient
wrench, but after the said period of time
elapsed my attorney informed me it was rejected
by the chief examiner on account of
prior similar claims already patented. Of
course you must not get confused and wonder
why he didn’t tell me this before I filed
the application. If he had the self-explanatory
portion of the scheme loses its self respect
and puts the attorney in a bad financial
light, which I would dislike to do. However,
the discouraging news was so cool and saddening
at this first attempt that it froze my
ingenuity a decade and a quarter, and then
hope rose again and I called once more on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
the dormant faculty and changed attorneys.
</p>
<p>
After due diligence had persevered and I
had stood the condemnation of my wife, who
said I was getting absent-minded and hard of
hearing, I sent in my application duly witnessed
and sworn to, along with the necessary
stipend that makes the wheels buzz in
the attorney’s head and swells that seven millions
of profit accrued in the patent office
from a good many fellows like myself. Nice
to help swell this big profit for some day
when this accumulation becomes large enough
our wise custodians of this fund may transfer
it like ordinary Town Council men do when
one fund gets too far ahead and pay off the
national debt. My second application was an
improved index and a device of meritable
convenience over present ones, so I thought.
It has been pending two years after failing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
ten times before the chief examiner, who
doesn’t seem to have the courtesy to allow it.
</p>
<p>
While the invention was safe and secure in
the government vault, I was rash enough to
go into another irrational period and get out
a computing device for the busy coal man to
aid him in rapid accurate calculations and do
away with the old time method of having
coal swell so sixteen hundred pounds was a
ton; not really a long ton but a short ton.
This wonderful invention hatched in the
brain of an ordinary man, lingered in Washington
one year and a half, and was then rejected.
I wouldn’t care for having it rejected,
but I’d like to have the rejectors use a
milder word, one that doesn’t rankle so much
and stir up the mean things in you.
</p>
<p>
Well, here are two great inventions for the
betterment of the race denied, and from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
way the attorney wrote in his last tribute of
love to me, the third is hanging over the precipice
and is ready to fall among its ancestors.
</p>
<p>
I had hopes when I invested in the last
two ideas, my total expenditures, including
postage on a voluminous amount of correspondence,
was $141.28, and this is how I
disbursed the interest on that amount:—I
calculated conservatively that the two inventions
would net me $50,000. Here she goes!
To my father-in-law, for giving away his
daughter to me, for which I have never paid,
$1,000.00; to two sisters-in-law that favored
my suit, $1,000.00 each; to a brother-in-law that
did the square thing by me, $1,000.00; to my
oldest brother, who continually hammered me
when I was young and smaller than he, $1,000.00;
to a younger brother, whom I could
hammer, $1,000.00; to my four sisters,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
$1,000.00 each. Ten thousand of the iron men
at work. The next $20,000 I put at interest
in Colorado, where it is easy to get a ten per
cent rate. This would bring me in $2,000.00
a year to live on, and by being frugal I
might be able to smoke a five cent cigar occasionally
and let the corn cob pipe have a
chance to dry up some of its nicotine. The
next $10,000 went to old people who have
nearly reached the summit of their lives, but
on account of the feebleness of their limbs,
poor eyesight and a meagre pocketbook, the
final ascent overtaxes their small reserve of
strength and with want and sacrifice being in
the majority they can’t quite make it. To
these aged and needy people I would give
$500.00 cash. This amount would render their
last days comfortable, free from worry and
care. That helps twenty old couples, forty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
people that are worthy and needy. The remaining
$10,000 goes from my pocket in
ready cash to people met every day, people
whose countenances have rigidly printed
thereon a silent appeal for sympathy and
help. A meal to the man suffering from the
pangs of hunger; $50.00 to a woman making
her living over a washboard and fighting a
losing fight against poverty to rear her brood;
$100.00 for a present and a Christmas tree to
poor little children who never have the pleasure
of unwrapping a doll or any kind of a
toy; $5.00 to a laboring man looking for
work; $10.00 on a subscription list to help a
poor widow bury her boy; $25.00 to the man
in the pulpit preaching straight from the
shoulder; $10.00 for a railroad ticket to take
a girl home who expected work in the city
but didn’t find it. And so goes the remaining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
$10,000, here a little and there a little. I think
I could gladden more hearts with this last
$10,000 than the great man who spent millions
in libraries and free reading rooms
throughout the country. With all due respect
to him, the man in overalls and the girl who
must work are the ones who need literature
the worst, but the struggle for existence is so
keen they haven’t time to read books and they
feel humiliated and unwelcome in their everyday
garb mingling with the better dressed
people. The well-groomed man and woman of
today, in a large sense, doesn’t apply any too
closely the ethics of the Galilean and would
rather not mingle with the less fortunate people,
so the conclusive thesis is there is no
congeniality between the two and the primary
object of helping the fellow who needed it
most is a failure. But alas, the $50,000 is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
still behind the capitalist and must wait for
hope to rise again.
</p>
<p>
Not feeling satisfied but that there was
plenty of loose coin waiting to flow to me, I
took up the pleasant but unprofitable part avocation
of composing songs. I had a Washington
music firm write the music, copyright
the songs in my name, do the advertising, and
remit one-half the proceeds to me semi-annually
January 31st and July 31st. I was
very careful to set out specifically the remitting
part in our contract. Each song had its
own peculiarity and sentiment to touch the
public pulse, which so far has been untouchable.
The first song, “A Tear Drop Always
Glistened in His Eye,” was to fasten itself on
the hearts of the people like “Annie Laurie.”
“When the Silver Moon Light Sparkles on
the Lake” made its bow to the public; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
hoped lovers with emotion would go wild over
it and would know a good thing when they
heard it. If they had such a feeling the emoluments
failed to show it. The third song,
“Anna, My Anna,” was short and jerky for
the happy-go-lucky class of people that fell
so in love with “Casey Jones.” But it seems
this class wouldn’t respond either, and leaves
me with the entire stock on hand with an expenditure
of $90.00 trying to get the people
to sing. I find them more unresponsive than
the preacher when he says let everybody sing,
and a few who gave their best years in the
Lord’s service lift up their cracked voices in
earnest endeavor to lead the sheep, and the
sheep, lambs and all go astray. My share of
the profits has been ten one cent postage
stamps, just the ordinary kind, the common
kind you can get from every postoffice in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
country. And the trio which failed to receive
public recognition I laid away where
moths and rust doth not decrease their earning
power and neither do thieves molest them.
Three more hopes decently but sadly buried.
</p>
<p>
There is also intertwined and resting
sweetly in slumberland 175 shares of Cracker
Engle Gold Mine Stock at twenty cents per
share and twelve years accrued interest. I
had the customary notice before I bought that
the stock would advance rapidly in price and
if I invested without hesitation and without
investigation I would have the benefit of the
first and early advance. I hearkened to the
alluring honey literature and sent a U. S.
money order, something whose face value
couldn’t be questioned. I wanted to be absolutely
sure I’d get the stock. I got it all right.
I have such faith in that stock that I can go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
anywhere and leave it behind unlocked doors
and it never strays away.
</p>
<p>
A home boy succeeded in getting a patent
on an improved table. He incorporated under
the laws where Wilson was governor and
then invited capital for manufacturing purposes.
He styled his invention “The Great
Western Improvement Company” and sold
seventeen shares at the flat sum of $5.00. I
learned a little from the crack at the Cracker
Eagle and did not fly so high and only took
the $5.00 worth. It’s comical now, to me, how
the inventor and promoter explained how his
table was superior to the common ordinary
everyday table that’s been in use so long. It
had a hollow holding receptacle in the center
and he said after the meal had been stowed
away and nothing was left but the dishes and
flies, the housewife could, if she felt so disposed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
elevate a handle and the soiled dishes
would disappear and the table would have an
inviting appearance. He said it was especially
fine when conversation had been brisk
and company or peddlers were seen coming;
all that was necessary was the quick jerk of
the ever-ready handle and down out of sight
went the dishes, flies, napkins, and everything
untidy and untasty. I was looking for
votes when this investment was made and
while the votes may not have had an equal
value I let it go at that and put away the
stock for my grandchildren. Another share
of stock in the Campbells’ Farming Association
at a cost of $5.00 brings my get rich
quick investments to a finis. The only other
stock I ever had was bank stock. I invested
$1,500.00 in a State Bank in Nebraska. I
didn’t lose on this deal but the money would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
have paid better on a straight five per cent
rate.
</p>
<p>
Nothing would have done me more good
and brought a keener satisfaction than to
have had a nice remuneration from some investment
that I have made. My wife called
me what the bible says she shouldn’t so many
times that it seems to look like I am really
a bigger one than she said I was, and if I
could have changed her mind by laying before
her eyes a nice portly check for $5,000.00
or $10,000.00 it would have been such an
agreeable surprise not only to her but to myself
that we both would have enjoyed it, and
especially myself if I could have pulled it
over. But if hope don’t come again I will
have to let that excellent pleasure be like
Mathewson’s speedy one and fade away.

A lad of the average type at twenty-one has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
a great deal of stored up energy; he has the
muscle bank and the brain bank from which
to get his necessary resources, and a great
many lads think Dad is a back number
and he sees where the old gentleman was
short on gray matter, and all advice is lost
on this sort of boys. I was never conceited
this way, in fact I think somebody else got
nearly all the gall that should have been
mine. If a fellow holds his own in these
days, no matter what party is in power, Democratic
or Republican, you need your full allowance
of gall. The lad that thinks that
the governor’s gray matter is not as profuse
as it should be, but he, through some unknown
force, grabbed all that was coming to him
and part of dad’s might read the following
verse and the conclusive portion of this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
chapter and apply it from a stand point of
ordinary horse sense:

It makes the pain come home when you
look back from fifty and realize that a man
at twenty-one is a darn big fool, at thirty
still a fool, at thirty-five a little foolish, and
at forty he still has some, at forty-five wisdom
breaks in gently, and at fifty he stands
on the threshold of learning ready to apply
and absorb, and at sixty he’s a valuable asset
to his community and country.

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span><a name='ch14' id='ch14'></a>THE WEARY TRAVELER.</h2>
<p>
Something has been gained and our life
has not been futile if we can say we owe no
man and there is no obligation through which
we have passed, financial or otherwise, of
which we are ashamed. We may not have
acquired honor, wealth or position but if we
have lived up to the teachings of the plumb
and the square, we have a record that will
stand the closest investigation when we knock
for entrance at the pearly gates. If we can
stand with our whole soul bared before our
maker and he sees that chastity and the sweet
purity of any girl or woman has never been
trespassed upon we have acquired something
that brings smiles to angels’ faces. If we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
have stood firm when temptations surged and
tossed and clamored and we met them and
conquered, we have through our moral force
a better right to the precious gems of God’s
kingdom than those saved in the eleventh
hour. If we have never repeated unwholesome
stories or spoken slightingly of another’s
character or said disrespectfully something
that we knew untrue, then we have lived well.
Each day’s battles must be fought alone and
leave tomorrow’s till they come. Never tear
down character, it is the choicest gift in the
universe and constitutes life’s work. Remember
a pure woman or a pure man is the noblest
work of God. Don’t let your footsteps slip
from the path of virtue but plant them firm
and deep in the path of righteousness. Keep
away from people whose thoughts are degrading,
and never harbor foul and indecent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
language. Make it your most earnest desire
to avoid using profanity and vile utterances,
an immoral epithet has a clinging effect which
takes years to erase, and those that emulate
and make us better takes determination and
purity.
</p>
<p>
I am now approaching the half-century
mark. I can look ahead a few years and see
the fiftieth mile post. In all the years that
have past and gone I can recall none where
my conditions and prospects are so alarming,
serious and discouraging as at the present
time. I have a peculiar ailment in my left
side that has baffled the medical fraternity
and caused extreme anxiety to myself. I
have endeavored with courage and determination
to exterminate it. I have tried assiduously
physical culture, osteopathy, dietics,
Christian science and medicine. I have consulted freely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
and often the great physician
and all so far have failed. With treatment
at Hot Springs thrown in as good measure.
The surgeons say an operation is
the only hope through which they can discover
the cause and eliminate it. I dread
operations like I do “Good Wills” and
“Bonuses.” My wife had one and the doctor
in charge said she would be a well woman in
three weeks, but those three weeks were
worse than that two weeks’ loan. They
stretched into six long, bitter years and were
the direct cause of an outlay of money in excess
of three thousand dollars. Glad again
of the early use of that harrow, for there was
surely a gross violation of the truth on the
part of the surgeon. On account of dearie’s
precarious health I was forced to try a lower
altitude, and this not being sufficient it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
necessary to try the balmy, sunny air of California
and sojourn there among the orange
blossoms and the singing birds for seven long
months. This caused me to give up my position
of clerk that netted me in my four years’
labor the tidy sum of ten thousand dollars.
</p>
<p>
Today as I stand looking at that fiftieth
mile post I realize in the vernacular of the
day “I am up against it.” My money is gone,
my ailment bothers me, I have a family to
provide for, and the wolf stands on the
threshold with his mouth open and his long,
gaunt body in readiness to make the jump.
In some way I must appease five empty
stomachs from consuming five back bones.
My investments were bad. I tied up thirty-five
hundred dollars in a partnership lumber
business, fifteen hundred dollars in a home
to shelter my loved ones, and the rest went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
for food and clothing. I struck a highly
modern town with all the up-to-date conveniences,
property depreciated fifty per cent,
business was stagnant, interest kept gnawing,
and taxes went skyward. The two sad mistakes
I made was: first, to visit the office of
the County Treasurer and learn about the
taxes; and the second was to stay out of
business unless we had enough money to pay
for it and keep to the leeward of that ten
per cent interest, but I didn’t and so much
more for experience, the grandma of teachers.
</p>
<p>
I do not lack courage and determination
but knowing and being able to see that fiftieth
mile post causes a shudder and slight touches
of despondency. I think my training is more
than is alloted the average man. I have been
a day laborer on the farm, railroad and hay
field. I have worked for a large number of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
task masters and I failed to remember when
I was ever criticised for not keeping up my
end. I have held a good many positions of
trust such as census enumerator, section foreman,
extra gang foreman, county clerk, clerk
of the district court, abstractor, town trustee,
and member of the school board.
</p>
<p>
The first time I was a candidate for county
clerk I ran on the Republican ticket. I am
not telling this in any spirit of the braggart
but as a sample of confidence. In my old
home precinct I received one hundred and
twenty votes out of one hundred and thirty-two,
and in the precinct where I worked as
section foreman I received forty votes out of
forty-eight, and this had always been a strong
Democratic precinct. My opponent was a
strong candidate and entirely familiar with
political tactics, an old scholar in the school.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
But when the votes were counted I received
the certificate of election and laid down the
tamping bar and took up the pen. I could
have established a precedent and been elected
again but dearie’s health would not permit
and I declined to run.
</p>
<p>
Some say the hand of fate guides our destinies
and it was so to be, but I am at a loss
to understand why it should so be. I have
lived clean, I have always met my obligations
with the strictest honor, no marks of dissipation,
inwardly or otherwise, have scarred my
form and thank God he nor any other can
find any danger signals that can isolate me
from a free transport to the narrow path. I
have been economical, conservative and kind
and I think I have done my very best. I have
treated every one with the closest application
that can be unravelled from the ten commandments and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
the additional commandment established
through Christ.
</p>
<p>
All through my married life I have been
attentive to my wife and in any room of our
mortgaged home you can see many tokens of
affection that she has received. I have endeavored
to lighten her domestic burden and
almost every Monday morning for the past
twelve years I have been the propeller at the
washing machine. Hundred of times I have
arisen between the hours of three and four
and wended my way to the family kitchen
and waded in on the soiled linen. I never
sneaked out the back way to avoid using the
tea towel on waiting dishes. I can use the
broom, duster and make the beds. I can
scrub, polish the stove, cook the steak, and
perform almost the entire category of domestic
needs; but when it comes to baking I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
would rather face the cannon’s mouth (a
silent one like in the city park in Denver) and
die like a martyr. I have often acted as maid.
I recall once when I was a maid my wife was
bed fast for three weeks. We lived in a
strong church town, somewhere near eighty
per cent, it seemed nearly all were Christians
but during dearie’s sickness there was not a
single Christian woman or suffragist came to
see her, offered her services, or was in any
way interested. I am sorry this happened in
this broad land of boasted Christianity and
civilization. Some of these same Christian
ladies never failed to appear when the dues
for foreign missions were bordering on delinquency
or when some rations were needed
for a church spread.
</p>
<p>
I believe in doing good and giving cheer.
You can always notice a gleam of pleasure in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
your wife’s face when you give her a box of
candy, a dress, a dish, or some little token,
and how she clings to the missiles of love
that you may have penned on scraps of paper,
chunks of wood and other things. They always
speak for something I think meritable.
I think the pathway of dearie can be made
more cheerful if she is remembered daily and
not all in one chunk at Christmas time, and
then let her wait for another twelve months.
I never feared I would kiss my wife too
much. I kiss her more now than when I
courted her and they are just as sweet as
ever. It helps to keep the love light in her
eye.
</p>
<p>
I have three fine children. I am not conceited
about them; other people say they are
good. I have done my best to raise them
well. Two of them are in the County High
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
School, the eldest a girl of sweet sixteen and
the other a noisy boy of fourteen. The remaining
one is a baby of two and one-half
years. I must leave these three children and
dearie and look for employment. You can
realize how pleasant it is to be separated from
them. How sad it is to kiss dearie and the
others good bye and have the many cute sayings
of a strongly attached baby ringing in
your ears, not only through the dreary, lonesome
days but long after the shadows fall.
</p>
<p>
Such is life with its pains and sorrows.
They come to us all and while I may think
my road is rougher than is allotted the ordinary
individual I suppose others think the same.
The one great consolation I have is that dearie
is almost a strong, well woman, and that is
worth all I have passed through and I would
gladly undergo it again for her. I must be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
getting ready, the colonists reduced rates of
our liberal hearted “S-T-E-E-L” railroads is
near the finis of the twelve-day limit. The
parting is at hand. I kiss the loved ones
good bye, cling tenaciously to my second-class
ticket, guard well my pneumatic pocket
book with its ragged puncture and try again
in pretty California among the salty ocean
breezes, the cheerful flowers, the fragrant
orange blossoms and the shady pepper trees
to find work and health for those I love.
GOOD BYE.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
